Australia won the toss and opted to bat under a cloudy sky in Benoni, and immediately got off to a fiery start. Raj Limbani was the first to strike from an Indian bowling outfit that had looked so dominant before the final, producing a brilliant inswinger to go through the defence of Sam Konstas.¬† India introduced Saumy Pandey into the attack early, hoping to capitalize on any vulnerability Hugh Weibgen may have had against left-arm spin. The Australian skipper had been dismissed by left-arm spinners in three matches in the tournament prior to the final, and once by Pandey himself in a warm-up game in January. But with the left-handed Dixon at the other end, the Aussie pair rotated strike easily against the Indian bowlers. Captain Uday Saharan turned to Musheer Khan, another left-arm spinner, to save Pandey‚Äôs overs, but the Webgen-Dixon partnership grew in confidence. Though the introduction of spin momentarily slowed the scoring rate, it failed to yield wickets. Consequently, India reverted to pace after 11 successive overs of spin. It immediately reaped dividends. Tiwari induced a miscue from Weibgen, who drove straight to Musheer at backward point for 48. Tiwari struck again in his next over, coaxing Dixon to lob one skyward with a well-disguised knuckle ball. With two quick wickets, India clawed their way back into contention, but Harjas Singh, who had previously struggled for form in the tournament, rose to the occasion with a crucial knock. Teaming up with Ryan Hicks, Harjas anchored the Australian innings. With only two frontline quicks and the medium pace of Arshin Kulkarni at their disposal, India had little choice but to turn back to spin. However, the Aussie pair continued to accumulate runs with minimal risk. Harjas opened up against Priyanshu Moliya, smashing him for a six and a four to assert his dominance on the bowling attack. He continued to take full toll on the spinners while Hicks found gaps to rotate the strike regularly. The return of Limbani brought a wicket as the seamer trapped Hicks in front for 20 to break the partnership. Harjas continued unperturbed and completed a fine half-century ‚Äì his first in the tournament ‚Äì off 59 balls. Pandey came back into the attack in the 38th over and trapped Harjas in front for 55 to give India a massive breakthrough. Musheer added another scalp, that of Raf MacMillan, in the 40th over and Australia slipped from 165/3 to 187/6. Ollie Peake, coming in off a match-winning knock in the semi-finals, and Charlie Anderson built steadily before Limbani picked up his third wicket by trapping the latter in front in the 46th over.¬† Peake remained unbeaten on 46 as Australia finished on 253, the highest total registered in a final of an U19 Men‚Äôs CWC.¬† India had a daunting target ahead of them against a formidable pace attack.

The mounting pressure gave way to the first wicket¬†‚Äì¬†Vidler had Kulkarni edging behind off a delivery that seamed away. Australia had their first strike, and it forced India into defensive mode with Adarsh Singh and Musheer Khan aiming to survive the new ball spells from the Aussie quicks. Musheer showed early glimpses of promise with some fine shots, one of them a seamless punch down the ground for four. However, Mahli Beardman was introduced into the attack and the extra pace of an angled delivery into the right-hander exposed a gap in the batter‚Äôs defence. India‚Äôs most reliable batter in the tournament, their skipper Uday Saharan, joined Adarsh in the middle with his side in huge trouble. The scoring rate hadn‚Äôt picked up, and they were staring at a big target with two wickets down already. Saharan attempted to break free after a cautious start, but an aggressive drive resulted in a thick edge that found its way to Weibgen at backward point as Beardman struck for the second time in quick succession.¬† India‚Äôs woes compounded as Sachin Dhas, the in-form batter, perished to MacMillan‚Äôs first ball. The off-spinner had Dhas caught behind for nine as India leaving India in dire straits at 68/4. Adarsh found some company from Moliya and the stand got India into the nineties, but he top-edged a pull off Anderson and the resistance was broken. Aravelly Avanish gave a return catch to MacMillan in the next over and India were six down.¬†¬† Sensing the increasing need to add runs, Adarsh attempted to accelerate his subdued innings, finding boundaries with a four and a six off Vidler. However, he ultimately nicked a short ball from Beardman to the ‚Äòkeeper, departing after a patient vigil at the crease, having scored 47. Murugan Abhishek provided some late fireworks, but it was too little, too late for India, who were too far adrift from the target to mount a successful comeback. He finished on 42, miscuing a pull off Vidler‚Äôs final over.¬† India were bowled out for 174, finishing second-best. Beardman walked away with the Player of the Match award for what proved to be a match-winning spell of three for 15 from his seven overs.

Saharan's team will now have the chance to defend their title in the final on Sunday, 11 February. India now await the winner of the second semi-final match between Australia and Pakistan on Thursday to see who they will face in the title clash. Securing a thrilling win ‚úÖStitching a match-winning partnership ü§ùStory behind the name 'Sachin' üòÉOn the mic with #U19WorldCup Semi-Final Heroes - Captain Uday Saharan & Sachin Dhas üëåüëåWATCH üé•üîΩ #TeamIndia | #BoysInBlue | #INDvSAhttps://t.co/RfjGfQEw2P After losing four tosses in the first four games, Uday Saharan got it right for the second in a row and chose to field first. This was the first time that India bowled first in the tournament, having batted in each of their five victories so far. Once again displaying his customary aggression in the tournament, South Africa opener Steve Stolk took charge early on, hitting two fours in the first three overs. He continued his onslaught with a maximum off Raj Limbani in the fifth but it was the Indian pacer who had the last laugh as Stolk's attempted cut resulted in an edge straight into the hands of the wicketkeeper. Lhuan-dre Pretorius kept the foot on the pedal thereafter, including a six and a four against Naman Tiwari in the 8th over. At the other end though, Limbani was on the money and accounted for the wicket of David Teeger for a duck, rattling the stumps with a peach of an inswinger. By the end of the Powerplay, South Africa were going close to a run-a-ball. Saharan decided to introduce his spinners into play, effectively curbing South Africa's scoring ‚Äì only five boundaries were scored in the span of overs 11 to 30. With the run-rate at less than four, the mounting pressure got to Pretorius, who tried to swat Musheer Khan over mid-wicket, but Murugan Abhishek showed brilliant reflexes to hang on to a stunning catch. The Proteas saw an uptick in boundaries when Seletswane and Oliver Whitehead combined for a 45-run partnership. Just as the partnership started to look dangerous, Musheer struck with the final ball of his spell, dismissing Whitehead. Dewan Marais holed out to Saumy Pandey inches inside the boundary for just 3. Between the two wickets, Seletswane brought up a patient half-century but having taken 90 balls to get to the milestone, the youngster fell trying to make up for the scoring rate. Seletswane tried to take the attack to Naman Tiwari but was undone by a good catch by Priyanshu Moliya running in from the deep. Juan James too departed after a solid 19-ball 24-run cameo, leaving South Africa at 221/7 with two overs to go. Tristan Luus gave the innings some much-needed impetus in the final two overs, unleashing two sixes and a four to finish with an unbeaten 23 off 12 balls. As a result, South Africa set India a target of 245. This was the first time a team had got past the 200-run mark against India in the tournament so far.

Captain Saharan and Sachin Dhas then orchestrated a remarkable rescue mission with an impressive partnership. With runs drying up, the pair mixed caution with aggression to keep the scoreboard ticking. Particularly targeting the bowling of Riley Norton, Dhas showcased his prowess by striking three boundaries in a single over, reclaiming some control for India. While Saharan held firm at one end, Dhas assumed the role of the aggressor, racing to a half-century off 47 balls to keep the required run rate under 6. Saharan quickly found his rhythm with a splendid boundary off James, not only marking the 100-run partnership for the fifth wicket but also propelling himself past Musheer Khan to claim the top spot on the tournament run-scoring charts. The partnership between the two was a masterclass in innings building and chasing, as they milked singles relentlessly while putting the poor deliveries away for boundaries. The skipper too got in on the act, reaching his fifty off 88 balls with a boundary as India inched closer to victory. Just as the required run rate got to a run-a-ball, Dhas and Saharan dispatched James for a six and four respectively to calm the nerves in the Indian camp. But there was another twist as South Africa hit back when Maphaka was reintroduced into the attack. He got the better of Dhas with a well-disguised slower ball, the batter falling agonisingly short of a century on 96. Aravelly Avanish displayed nerves of steel by striking a crucial boundary off Norton on the final ball of the 46th over. India lost Avanish and Murugan Abhishek in quick succession though but a six from Raj Limbani shifted the equation, bringing it down to nine runs required off the last two overs. Saharan put to rest any hopes of a South African comeback with four off the first ball of the penultimate over. In another twist to the game, Saharan was run out trying to scramble for the winning run. However, Limbani came in clutch again and struck a four off the final ball of the over to continue their unbeaten run and book their berth in the final. The Player of the Match, India captain Uday Saharan, shared insights in the post-match presentation after bailing the team out of early trouble. ‚ÄúI just believed in myself [after coming out to bat]. I knew it was a matter of one partnership, and the game would be ours. I just kept telling myself repeatedly that I needed to bat till the end.‚Äù","In a thrilling contest that went down to the wire, India secured a hard-fought victory, thanks to outstanding half-centuries from Uday Saharan and Sachin Dhas. Saharan's team will now have the chance to defend their title in the final on Sunday, 11 February. India now await the winner of the second semi-final match between Australia and Pakistan on Thursday to see who they will face in the title clash.

This was the first time that India bowled first in the tournament, having batted in each of their five victories so far. Once again displaying his customary aggression in the tournament, South Africa opener Steve Stolk took charge early on, hitting two fours in the first three overs. He continued his onslaught with a maximum off Raj Limbani in the fifth but it was the Indian pacer who had the last laugh as Stolk's attempted cut resulted in an edge straight into the hands of the wicketkeeper. Lhuan-dre Pretorius kept the foot on the pedal thereafter, including a six and a four against Naman Tiwari in the 8th over. At the other end though, Limbani was on the money and accounted for the wicket of David Teeger for a duck, rattling the stumps with a peach of an inswinger.
