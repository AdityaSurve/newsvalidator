In preparation for the Olympic Games, he has chalked his plans. He will compete on May 28 in Ostrava (Czech Republic) and Turku (Finland) in June. Thereafter, he will assess his fitness. “I will see how my body and mind reacts to high quality competitions and then take a call, “ he disclosed.

Neeraj Chopra’s personal best and national record of 89.94m was recorded in 2022. The champion thrower said he was working hard and on a good day should be able to breach 90m. “I prefer to win and not think of distance,” he explained.

Star javelin throw Neeraj Chopra adds spice to domestic competition in Bhubaneswar,"May 11, 2024","Bhubaneswar

While the crore group of 400m runners are raring to go for the season first domestic track and field competition starting Sunday here at Bhubaneswar’s eight-lane Kalinga Stadium in Odisha, main attraction will be men’s javelin throw as Olympic and world champion Neeraj Chopra will compete in Bhubaneswar. It will be the first time since the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, Chopra will be seen in action on the India soil.

Asian Games medalist Kishore Kumar Jena will also compete in four-day 27th National Federation Senior Athletics Competition, a Paris Olympic Games qualification event. The competition has attracted more than 700 athletes, including 180 female athletes.

Both Chopra and Jena have qualified for the Paris Olympic Games and a domestic meet in Bhubaneswar will be part of their Olympic Games preparation.

Last night at Doha Diamond League, a season opening competition, Chopra claimed second position behind Jacub Vadlejch (88.38m) of Czech Republic with a throw of 88.36m, while Jena’s best attempt was 76.31m. Jena finished ninth.

Country’s top quarter milers, after successfully booking relay berths in 4x400m relay event at the just concluded World Athletics Relay in Bahamas, will test themselves in an individual event in Bhubaneswar. “Will be running an individual 400m here in Odisha to improve my world ranking,” was Amoj Jacob’s response during media interaction on Saturday.

The 400m qualification round is scheduled for May 14. The medal round will be on May 15.

Jacob ran anchor leg in the men’s 4x400m during the second round of Paris Olympic Games qualification in Bahamas. “It was a challenging situation during the second round of Olympic Games qualification but the team was confident of making the cut for the Olympic Games,” Jacob added. “We are happy to have booked tickets for relay events to Paris.”

Apart from Jacob, Muhammad Ajmal (men), Jyothika Sri Dandi and Subha V (women) will be seen in action during the four-day competition.

Radhakrishnan Nair, chief athletics coach said, the 63rd National Inter State Senior Athletics Championships from June 27 to 30 in Panchkula, Haryana, will be the last domestic competition for the athletes to make the cut for the Paris Olympic Games. “The deadline to qualify for the Paris Olympic Games is June 30. It is mandatory for all athletes to compete in Panchkula to prove themselves,” chief athletics coach added. “There are few exceptions but the majority of aspiring athletes aiming to make the cut for the Paris Olympic Games will be in action in Panchkula.”

According to the chief athletics coach, the race walking event has been scrapped in Panchkula as the core group of race walkers who have qualified for Paris Olympic Games wanted more time to recover from the World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships held on April 21 in Turkey. “Five male race walkers have achieved Paris Olympic Games qualification time, but only the top three will be selected for the Olympic Games scheduled to be held in Paris from July 26.”

Chief athletics coach was hopeful of a better and steady performance in Bhubaneswar after a series of warm up domestic competitions conducted in March and April. “Bhubaneswar will be a good platform for the athletes to further assess their performance,” he explained.

Athletes from Bangladesh and Maldives have also confirmed their entries for the National Federation Senior Athletics Competition, chief athletics coach said. The domestic meet in Bhubaneswar is sponsored by the Odisha government.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Article-Neeraj.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/star-javelin-throw-neeraj-chopra-adds-spice-to-domestic-competition-in-bhubaneswar/,Athletics
"Two Indians javelin throwers will join 90m club in future, says world champion Neeraj Chopra","October 11, 2023","AFI Media

New Delhi

India’s world and Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra on Wednesday said domestic competition in javelin throw will be more exciting in future. The 25 years old star javelin thrower categorically pointed towards Odisha’s rising javelin thrower and Asian Games silver medalist Kishore Kumar Jena.

“In future I see two Indian javelin throwers joining the 90m club,” Chopra said on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony of the Asian Games athletics contingent by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI).

Chopra started his season by winning javelin at Doha Diamond League in May but pulled his groin and had to skip a couple of international events. However, he recovered from the niggle and bounced back to win gold at the 2023 World Athletics Championships held in Hungary and successfully defended his title at the Asian Games.

Chopra revealed that Jena’s performance during the just concluded 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou acted as a catalyst to rekindle his energy.

“It was a healthy rivalry between me and Jena during the medal round in the men’s javelin throw in Hangzhou,” Chopra added.

While Chopra won the gold with a throw of 88.88m, Jena settled for silver with a throw of 87.54m.

But at one juncture of the javelin competition in Hangzhou, Jena took the pole position with a throw of 86.77m While Chopra was trailing at second spot with a throw of 84.49m.

The lead was temporary as Chopra dug deep into his reservoir to hurl the spear to a distance of 88.88m to win gold. Jena’s best throw of 87.54m fetched him silver.

At the 19th Asian Games, Indian athletics contingent won 29 medals, six of them gold, 14 silver and nine bronze.

Adille Sumariwalla, president, AFI said the Indian squad could have enhanced the gold medal tally in Hangzhou but didn’t capitalize on the chances. “I will say it was a bad miss in middle distance events and women’s 4x400m relay at the Asian Games,” Sumariwalla added.

Sumariwalla, who is one of the vice presidents at the World Athletics said the Indian athletes also gave a good account of their performance at the Budapest World Athletics Championship held between August 19 to 27. “While Neeraj Chopra was crowned world champion, Jena and Manu DP were in top six, which suggest the growing stature of Indian javelin throwers at the global stage,” Sumariwalla added.

Besides the javelin throw, the men’s 4x400m relay team was impressive and shattered the Asian record during heats at the World Athletics Championships. The national team eventually finished fifth in the final and clocked 2:59.92 seconds.

“The outstanding performance in a packed 2023 season was a big boost to the confidence of the Indian athletes ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games,” Sumariwalla added.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Article-Banner-Neeraj-Article-New-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/two-indians-javelin-throwers-will-join-90m-club-in-future-says-world-champion-neeraj-chopra/,Athletics

We are in constant touch with him to assist his recovery.”

On Sunday, Neeraj Chopra became India’s first male athlete to win a medal at the World Championships with an effort of 88.13m in the final at Hayward Field.

Neeraj Chopra launches Kids’ Javelin to build on the momentum of his Olympic Gold,"May 29, 2022","AFI Media

Chandigarh, May 29: Athletics Federation of India (AFI) on Sunday launched a Kids’ Javelin to sustain the momentum sparked by Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic Games gold medal in Tokyo. The Kids’ Javelin, designed and made by Vinex Sports, weighs just 300gm and will ensure safety of the athletes and everyone else around in the playfield. Neeraj Chopra himself launched the Kids’ Javelin through a video message from his overseas training location.

World Athletics Championships Long Jump silver medalist Anju Bobby George, AFI Senior Vice-President and 1962 Asian Games Decathlon gold medalist Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, AFI Selection Committee Chairman, were the first to receive the Kids’ Javelin from Vinex Sports Managing Director Ashuthosh Bhalla.

“We cannot let go of the spike in interest for athletics among youngsters in India. We had a Ball Throw event for Under-14 athletes, but we aim to replace that with the Kids’ Javelin Throw,” AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla told a media conference at the end of the two-day Annual General Assembly Meeting of the Federation at Hotel Shivalik here on Sunday.

“We have firmed up plans to widen the base of athletics even further and to provide better support to the athletes in both the development and elite stage. We are galvanizing the State and District Associations to draw more youngsters to our sport. For the best athletes in the country, we have got coaches from overseas to help their evolution,” he said.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot said the Federation was happy that athletes were showing improvement in many disciplines. “We are happy that we have three Triple Jumpers who have breached the 17m mark. We have grown in our traditional strength in the 400m and our young race walkers are showing promise,” he said.

In a major push towards digitalization across the board, AFI’s Units agreed to adopt an online entry system with an e-payment gateway for their respective State and Union Territory Championships. “Besides ensuring digital records of meets held around India, this move will help reduce the menage of age manipulation to a great extent,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

He said AFI reiterated its zero tolerance policy against doping in the AGM. “We are working with the National Anti-Doping Agency to try and keep our sport clean at all levels. We are educating our athletes, sharing intelligence with NADA about coaches and others suspected to be either carrying prohibited substances or encouraging younger athletes,” he said.

AFI also amended its Constitution in keeping with the Government’s request for compliance with the National Sports Code. It also resolved to enhance the popularity of its flagship National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet (NIDJAM). “We put systems and processes in place to ensure that track and field sport grows in the country,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neeraj-launches-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/neeraj-chopra-launches-kids-javelin-to-build-on-the-momentum-of-his-olympic-gold/,Athletics

AFI decides to mark August 7 every year as National Javelin Day to honour Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra,"August 10, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, August 10: The Athletics Federation of India has announced that August 7 each year would be celebrated as National Javelin Throw Day with competitions in all States and Union Territories to commemorate Neeraj Chopra’s feat of winning the country’s first athletics gold medal in the Olympic Games in Tokyo with a throw of 87.58m on Saturday.

“We will celebrate August 7 as National Javelin Day from next year to mark Neeraj’s victory. All our affiliated units will hold Javelin competitions in the respective States (and Union Territories). And a year later, we will get all our 600-plus district units also to have similar competitions on August7,” said AFI Planning Committee Chairman Lalit K. Bhanot at function to felicitate him.

The 23-year-old Neeraj Chopra, India’s first Olympic medallist in track and field sport, said he was humbled by the announcement. “I am feeling good that the AFI is making my achievement to be remembered in the years to come. I will be happier if my gold medal win inspires youngsters to take to athletics, especially Javelin Throw,” he said.

“If the children are getting the Javelins and other facilities, I am sure they will come and take up the sport. I will be happy to cheer for them and they can be medal winners in the future, he told reporters at the media interaction that followed the wonderful felicitation ceremony at the well-appointed Taj Palace banquet hall.

He said the turning point in his career was his inclusion in the National Camp after he finished fifth in the National Games in Kerala in 2015. “Everything changed after my joining the National Camp – equipment, training facilities and diet. The feeling of training with the best javelin throwers in the country was special,” he said.

“I had already won the gold in Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and now the Olympic Games. So, my next target is the gold in the World Athletics Championships (in Oregon) next year. The World Championships is a big competition and sometimes tougher than the Olympic Games.

“I am not going to be content with this Olympic gold. I will want to win the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games titles again,” he said, pointing out that he was concerned about a few athletes testing positive for Covid-19 in the Games Village and that he was worried for himself.

AFI Senior Vice-President Anju Bobby George, the first Indian to win a World Athletics Championships medal when she picked up Long Jump bronze in 2003, said she was proud of Neeraj Chopra’s achievement that had ended a long wait for an athletics medal at the Olympic Games.

"Avinash Sable, Neeraj Chopra and Tajinderpal Toor give India reason for cheer","March 17, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 17: Avinash Sable (Maharashtra) paid the best possible tribute to the late coach Nikolai Snesarev posting a new National Record time of 8 minutes 20.20 seconds as he won the men’s 3000m Steeplechase on the third day of the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Wednesday.

Along with javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, Sable gave India much reason for cheer. Neeraj Chopra broke his own meet record while Tajinderpal Toor had a superb series of throws.

Sable, who set the earlier National mark at 8:21.37 in the World Championships in Doha on October 4, 2019, broke free of the pack after a lap and a half and raced the clock. Having already secured Olympic qualification, the 26-year-old was a picture of determination and confidence as he chased his target time – almost as if to honour the late Belarussian coach.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra sustained his fine run of form with a massive throw over 87.80m on his final attempt which secured him a new meet record. Having raised the National record to 88.07m in the Indian Grand Prix III here on March 5, he showed a hunger for consistency and desire to embrace consistency rather than rest on his oars.

Earlier, 26-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) uncorked a series of big throws as he sought to meet the Olympic qualifying mark of 21.10m. Opening with a throw of 19.99m, the strapping left-hander went past the 20m mark on each of his four other legal throws, recording 20.20, 20.17, 20.58 and 20.47 with a foul on his fourth try.

The World No. 24 was looking to join 24 others who have achieved the Olympic entry standard. At the moment, he is third on the list of eight who can qualify on the basis of their world ranking. The final two attempts on Wednesday evening showed that he is getting better outcomes for his sustained efforts.

Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) played the waiting to game to perfection, letting Komal Jagdale (Maharashtra) set the pace but staying on her heels through the women’s 3000m Steeplechase only to sprint away in the final 200m to a secure comfortable win in the end. She was also superior at the water jumps where Komal Jagdale lost some precious time.

Priyanka Kerketta (Jharkhand) came up with a final effort of 6.10m to leapfrog to gold medal past Rintu Mathew (Kerala) and Sherin Abdul Gafoor (Tamil Nadu), who both had best efforts of 6.07m each. Priyanka Kerketta, 22, was lying in the fourth spot with a best of 6.01m but her final jump pushed Telangana’s Agasara Nandini out of the medal bracket.

Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) won the fastest of three men’s 800m semifinals, clocking 1:50.81 ahead of Krishan Kumar (Haryana) and Anu Kumar (Uttarakhand) but the with Asian Games gold medalist Manjit Singh (Haryana) in the fray, the final could see a faster time.

The women’s two-lap final will pit MR Poovamma against Delhi’s Chanda and Shalu Chaudhary as well as Lili Das (West Bengal) and Haryana’s Rachna.

On Tuesday, a few days shy of his 19th birthday, Usaid Khan (Uttar Pradesh) won the tough Decathlon with 6890 points. He built a total of 3572 points on the first day with good performances in the 100m and 400m sprints to insure against the strong second day challenge of Navjor Singh (Punjab). By improving his throwing, Usaid Khan can aspire to rise as an Asian Games prospect.

Neeraj Chopra overcomes windy conditions to break own National Record,"March 5, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 5: Neeraj Chopra warmed the hearts of Indian athletics fans with a National Record throw of 88.07m on his return to competitive fray after more than a year in the Indian Grand Prix III at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Friday. His best throw was a centimeter better than the record he set in the Asian Games in Jakarta on August 27, 2018.

Each of his four legal throws were better than the 81.63m that Shivpal Singh (Uttar Pradesh) managed with his fifth attempt on a day when the wind added to the challenge of the throwers. Neeraj Chopra, the 23-year-old from Haryana and possibly the first athlete to switch his mobile phone off in the run up to the Olympic Games, dealt with that challenge the best.

“There was a strong wind today and I have little experience of throwing in such windy conditions. My favourite Javelin was gaining much elevation in the wind. I then used another Javelin and focused on getting a good release. I didn’t feel I used much power with the fifth throw that went past the record,” he said.

“It feels good to be competing again after a long spell for the second time, first because of my injury and then because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am hopeful of giving off my best in all competitions and doing well for the country in the Olympic Games in Tokyo,” he said, well aware of the tough competition he will face. “I will do the best to take Indian athletics to new heights.”

There were other quality performances that drew the attention of the critics and fans. Amoj Jacob improved upon his personal best in the 400m yet again by stopping the clock at 45.70 seconds, a good three-tenths of a second faster than the time he had clocked in Indian Grand Prix II here last week.

Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor breached the 20m mark and Long Jumper M Sreeshankar showed consistency by hitting sand at 7.91m after having past 8m last week. In the 200m sprint, Muhammed Anas Yahiya clocked 21.48 seconds to sustain his speed work as part of his preparations for the 400m while Steeplechaser Avinash Sable showed good form to clock 8:24.40.

In the women’s events, Javelin Thrower Annu Rani tryst with throws in excess of 60m continued as she produced a best of 61.98m on Friday. She had another effort of 61.96m while four other throws were below the 60m mark. And, there was 400m-800m double for M R Poovamma while Hima Das, running alone, clocked a personal best time of 11.67 seconds in the 100m.

Yashvir heralds return of athletics by lowering Neeraj Chopra’s U20 FedCup meet mark,"January 25, 2021","Bhopal, January 25: Haryana’s Yashvir Singh stole the thunder from distance runners Sunil Dawar (Madhya Pradesh) and Ankita (Uttarakhand) as the trio heralded the return of national-level athletics competition with new meet records in the 18th National Federation Cup Junior (U20) Athletics Championships in the TT Nagar Stadium here on Monday.

The 19-year-old Yashvir Singh broke Neeraj Chopra’s meet record in winning the Javelin Throw with a best effort of 78.68m to surge past the 76.91m that had given Neeraj Chopra the meet record in Hyderabad in 2015. His five valid throws went past the 75m, the best coming from his second attempt.

The 18-year-old Ankita claimed the first new mark after national-level competition resumed after the Milo National Inter-District Junior Athletics Championships in Tirupati in November 2019, the Khelo India Youth Games in Guwahati in January 2020 and the Khelo India University Games in Bhubaneshwar in February 2020.

The girl from Uttarakhand ran the 5000m race at her own pace to finish in 16:37.90 to claim top honours in the Federation Cup Junior Athletics Championships for the second successive time. She lowered Suman Rani’s record of 17:02.67 set in Coimbatore in 2018. Ankita had won the 5000m race in Tiruvannamalai in September 2019 with a time of 17:16.49,

Ankita went on to add the 1500m title, doing just enough to stay ahead of Haryana’s Pooja and winning with a time of 4:27.54.

Sunil Dawar, a South Asian Games 5000m silver medallist in 2019, claimed the 1500m meet mark by clocking 3:48.54 to improve on the 3:51.16 set by Shashi Bhushan Singh in Hyderabad in 2015. With Sree Kiran finishing nearly 10 seconds later, Sunil Dawar would have been left wishing for stiffer competition and a crack at Ajay Kumar Saroj’s National mark of 3:44.96 set in 2016.

Saurabh Rajesh Naitam (Maharashtra) and Taranjeet Kaur (Delhi) emerged the fastest athletes of the meet, winning the men and women’s 100m sprints respectively in 10.51 seconds and 11.70 seconds.

AFI Nominates Deserving Neeraj Chopra For Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award,"June 3, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, June 3: Athletics Federation of India has nominated Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medal winning javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. Having captured the attention of athletics fans around the world when he won the crown in the World Junior Athletics Championships in 2016, he has been India’s leading athlete since.

“We are sure that Neeraj will get the nod this time around after he missed out on being picked for the award when weightlifter Mirabai Chanu edged him out in 2018 and wrestler Bajrang Punia was chosen ahead of him last year,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said. “The immensely popular athlete deserves the award for his performances ahead of the 2021 Olympics and it will motivate him to do even better.”

For the Arjuna Award, the AFI panel chaired by Anju Bobby George nominated 2018 Asian Games gold medallists, triple jumper Arpinder Singh and middle-distance specialist Manjit Singh as well as sprinter Dutee Chand, who won two Asian Games silver medals, and middle-distance runner PU Chitra who won gold medals in successive Asian Athletics Championships in 2017 and 2019 besides an Asian Games bronze.

“We believe that Awards selection committee will consider the fact that track and field sport is among the most intensely competed even in the continent. It is also important to remember that in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018, athletics accounted for 20 of 70 medals, including half of 16 gold, won by Indian sportspersons,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair, the only Indian to complete International Coaching Enrichment Certificate Programme by the International Olympic Committee with honors, has been nominated for the prestigious Dronacharya Award. “Radhakrishnan has selflessly hand-held many athletes and coaches over the past few years,” he said.

Kuldip Singh Bhullar, who won the discus throw silver medal in the 1982 Asian Games here, and sprinter Jincy Philip, who was part of the gold medal winning 4x400m relay team in the 2000 Asian Games in Busan, have been nominated for the Dhyan Chand Award, given for lifetime achievement to those who missed out on the Arjuna Award during their sports career.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-nominates-deserving-neeraj-chopra-for-rajiv-gandhi-khel-ratna-award/,Athletics
My only target is to give my best at the Asian Games: Neeraj Chopra,"August 16, 2018","AFI Media
16 August 2018

New Delhi. Neeraj Chopra will deservingly lead the Indian contingent at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games.  It is an honour the 20-year-old has earned by virtue of being amongst India’s best prospects for a gold medal at the Continental Games.

Chopra’s has top class credentials by virtue of being the first Indian to win a gold medal at a World Championships. This came courtesy his victory at the 2016 World Youth Championships. But Chopra has continued with his fine feats in the javelin throw.

In 2018, Chopra maintained his fine form, consistently throwing the javelin beyond the 85m mark this year and also has set a new national record of 87.43 at the Doha Diamond League in May.  In fact, the five best throws by an Asian athlete this year are all in his name. He has no shortage of titles too. The most significant of these was the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games at the Gold Coast in Australia which made Chopra only the first Indian javelin thrower to win that competition.

Chopra will however not be overconfident in Jakarta. Amongst his competitors is Chinese Taipei’s Chao Tsun-Cheng who holds the Asian record of 91.36m. However Cheng has been very inconsistent and has failed to produce his best throw when it has mattered most. At the Asian Championships last year, there had been great expectations of Cheng but he only managed to take sixth place with an effort of 80.03m. At that competition it was Chopra who had romped to the gold medal with a throw of 85.23m.

While Chopra will be bidding for gold, his compatriot Shivpal Singh could also get on the podium. Singh qualified for the Asian Games with a throw of 82.28m at the Inter State Championships. That mark leaves him in fourth place this year amongst Asian throwers. However with a bit of luck there is no reason why two Indians couldn’t stand on the steps.

Before flying to Jakarta from Finland where he is training with National javelin coach Uwe Hohn of Germany, Chopra said, “It is a great honor for me to lead the Indian contingent and carry the country’s flag at such a prestigious event. As far my preparations for the Asian Games are concerned, I want to say that I am not thinking about any medal or rank, all I want to do is give my best there,”

“These three-four months in Europe have been very productive and I got a chance to compete in a lot of competitions in between. I am feeling good and as I said, my only target is give my best in Jakarta,” said Chopra.

A similar feat might be possible on the first day of the athletics competition too in the men’s shot put event. Tejinder Pal Toor is supremely confident of a medal “I am a sure contender for a medal. Of course, I will aim for gold. That is the biggest prize any athlete strives for. But even if I miss the gold, I am almost certain that I will finish on the podium,” Toor said.

Toor has already won medals at the Asian level. Last year at the Asian Championships he finished just three centimeters behind eventually Iran’s Ali Samari. Toor will be aiming higher this time.

“Any medal is valuable, but a gold is a gold,” he has said. Amongst the Asian throwers this season, Toor has the top two throws including a 20.24m effort in March. A close second is Iran’s Mehrdelan Shahin who has a best throw of 19.92m. But also close to the top of the podium is another Indian Naveen Chikkara. The 22-year-old has a best effort of 19.57m. Chikkara though has been consistently throwing above 19m and could well contribute to a historic 1-2 finish.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/My-only-target-is-to-give-my-best-at-the-Asian-Games-Neeraj-Chopra.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/my-only-target-is-to-give-my-best-at-the-asian-games-neeraj-chopra/,Athletics

After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

Chopra was not the only athlete to impress though. Shot Putter Tajinder Pal Toor claimed gold in the men’s shot put with a best throw of 19.95m. While Tajinder has a personal best of 20.40m, recorded at the same venue in June last year, his throw on Tuesday was credible coming as early as it did in the season. Toor, improved on 19.77m he threw to claim a silver at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January this year. Toor finished ahead of Naveen Chikkara who threw the put 19.08m while the bronze went to Paramjeet Singh who only managed 16.74m.

Also coming close to the qualifying guideline was triple jumper Rakesh Babu. The Kerala jumper managed a best of 16.59m on Tuesday coming a centimeter short of the AFI standard of 16.60m. Babu’s effort however was good enough to win gold, edging Commonwealth bronze medalist Arpinder Singh who managed a best of 16.45m. National record holder Renjith Maheshwary finished third with a jump of 16.09m.

Amongst the other bright performers of the day were MP Jabir who claimed the 400m hurdles gold with a time of 50.60seconds, just shy of his personal best of 50.22m. Jabir finished ahead of Santhosh Kumar (50.85 seconds) and Binu Jose (52.77seconds). Upcoming triple jumper Renu produced a mini upset on the day.

Indian Athletics to mark National Javelin Day on August 7 to celebrate Neeraj’s Olympic gold,"August 5, 2022","AFI Media

 

New Delhi, August 5: Athletics Federation of India (AFI) and its affiliated units are all set to celebrate National Javelin Day across the country on Sunday to commemorate one of the greatest moments in India’s sporting history, Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic Games gold medal.  

It was on August 7 last year that Neeraj produced the 87.58m effort in Tokyo to earn India’s first track and field medal in the Olympic Games.

The decision to celebrate August 7 as the National Javelin Day was made by AFI upon Neeraj Chopra’s return from Tokyo. He has now added a World Championships Silver last month. “Apart from celebrating Neeraj’s feat, AFI will also promote the sport at the grassroots level through this initiative,” AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla said.

The 24-year-old Neeraj Chopra said he felt honoured that AFI has taken this initiative of organising Javelin competitions throughout the country on August7. “I request young athletes from all over India to take up the sport of Javelin Throw so we can have more champions in future,” he said. 

As many as 32 States and Union Territories units affiliated to AFI will organise Javelin competitions on August 7.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/aRTICLE-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indian-athletics-to-mark-national-javelin-day-on-august-7-to-celebrate-neerajs-olympic-gold/,Athletics
Javelin champion Chopra wins India’s first Olympic gold in athletics,"August 8, 2021","Neeraj Chopra made history in the javelin by becoming the first Indian to win an Olympic gold in athletics.

But the biggest surprise of the competition was not so much that Chopra won; it was that world leader Johannes Vetter finished down in ninth and didn’t make the cut to compete in the last three rounds.

Not to take anything away from Chopra’s victory, though, as he produced the two best throws of the competition.

He opened with 87.03m to take an early lead, while Germany’s Julian Weber went into second with 85.30m. Vetter, meanwhile, opened with 82.52m – a solid enough mark by anyone’s standards other than his own.

Chopra continued to apply the pressure on the rest of the field, improving to 87.58m in the second round.

The third round brought some of the biggest marks of the competition as 2013 world champion Vitezslav Vesely of the Czech Republic produced his best throw for six years, sending his spear out to 85.44m to move into second place.

In the same round, Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem landed an 84.62m throw, Aliaksei Katkavets of Belarus threw 83.71m and Finland’s Lassi Etelatalo managed 83.28m. Vetter, however, recorded another foul, and after the efforts of all the other finalists, the German was in ninth and would play no further part in the final.

Following a relatively uneventful fourth round, 2017 world silver medallist Jakub Vadlejch produced his best throw for three years to move into the silver medal position with 86.67m, pushing Weber out of the medals. The German tried to respond, but his 85.15m wasn’t quite enough to improve his position.

Neither Weber nor the two Czech throwers improved in the final round, as Chopra’s victory was confirmed. He ended his series with an 84.24m effort before heading off to celebrate his gold medal, shaking his head in disbelief as he made his way off the track.

“This feels awesome,” he said. “My training leading into this competition was good. We were very ready for the Olympics. After the qualifying round, I felt very good.

“I feel a bit bad about Vetter, he’s a great thrower,” added Chopra. “But I also had to focus on my throws. I can’t explain it, it’s an awesome feeling.”

For just the second time in history, 10 men threw beyond 82 metres.

New Delhi. India’s star athlete Neeraj Chopra broke his own national record at the IAAF Diamond League at the Qatar Sports Club in Doha on Friday night.

The 20-year-old Indian Army athlete finished fourth with an effort of 87.43m in a highly competitive field of the opening leg of the IAAF Diamond League.

The German athletes finished 1-2-3 in the competition with all hitting above 90m distance.

"AFI names Neeraj, Seema, PT Usha for sports awards","April 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 April 2018

New Delhi. Commonwealth Games gold medal winning javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has been recommended by the Athletics Federation of India for the country’s highest sporting honour – the Khel Ratna Award. In addition to the Khel Ratna, Chopra, 20, has also been recommended for the Arjuna Award by the federation. Chopra is one of three athletes who have been recommended for the Arjuna Award – with javelin thrower Annu Rani and four time Commonwealth Games medalist Seema Antil Punia also being recommended.

The federation has also nominated legendary athlete turned coach PT Usha for the Dronacharya Award.   India youth team coach, Sanjay Garnaik, has also been been recommended for the Dronacharya Award.

For Dhyanchand Award, the names of Boby Aloysis, Kuldeep Singh Bhullar and Jata Shankar have been recommended to the ministry by AFI while TP Ouseph is recommended for Life Time Achievement Award.

Neeraj Chopra-
The Commonwealth Games gold medal was only the latest of several accomplishments for Chopra in his short career so far. In 2016 he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at any world event in athletics when he claimed a gold at the World Youth Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His winning throw of 86.48m was both a national record as well as a still standing world record in the youth category. Chopra subsequently won a gold medal at the 2017 Asian Championships in Bhubaneswar. Favourite ahead of the Gold Coast games, Chopra would live up to that expectation. His throw of 86.47m would see him becoming only the fifth Indian athlete to have won a track and field gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.

Seema Punia Antil-
An Arjuna award for discus thrower Seema would be a suitable reward for a long career at the highest level. Seema was always destined for success, winning a medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships. Her excellent start at a junior level, however, hit the controversy immediately as she received a warning for the use of a stimulant- pseudoephedrine, a drug widely used in medications for common cold. Nevertheless, Seema has never been suspended and subsequently won a bronze at the 2002 World Junior Championships. The athlete competed nearly unstopped for the past two decades.  Starting with the 2006 edition in Melbourne, Seema has never finished out of the podium at the Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze and three silvers, the last of which came at the 2018 Games at Gold Coast. The 34-year-old athlete from Sonipat, Haryana, has also competed in 3 Olympic Games. In the last Asian Games at Incheon in 2014, Seema did India proud by winning a gold medal.
Bahadur Singh, Chairman of Arujna Award recommendation committee of AFI, said, “Seema deserves an Arjuna Award. She is one of the greatest and most consistent athlete India has produced. Her four-consecutive gold medals at Commonwealth Games proves that,”

PT Usha-
PT Usha’s Dronacharya Award nomination comes 34 years after she won both the Arjuna Award as well as the Padma Shri award for her achievement on the track – she had finished fourth at the 1984 Olympics. Usha who remains one of India’s most accomplished athletes with 11 medals at the Asian Games, had retired in 2000 with a promise to nurture a new crop of athletes. She has managed to do just that. The Usha school of athletics, formed in 2002 has consistently managed to produce athletes for the country. It’s most successful athlete has been 800m runner Tintu Luka. Luka has won two gold medals at the  Asian Championships and also a gold medal in the women’s 4x400m relay and a silver in the 800m at the 2014 Asian Games. Usha has continued producing athletes of excellence with Asian Junior champion Jisna Mathews the latest in the production line of excellence.
Annu Rani-
25-year-old Annu Rani is also in the running for an Arjuna Award. The national record holding javelin thrower, has won bronze medals at the 2014 Asian Games in Busan as well as the 2017 Asian championships in Bhubaneshwar. And although she missed making the Indian team at the Commonwealth Games, she would certainly be bidding to make up for it at the Asian Games in Jakarta.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AFI-names-Neeraj-Seema-PT-Usha-for-sports-awards.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-names-neeraj-seema-pt-usha-for-sports-awards/,Athletics
"Gold for Neeraj in Gold Coast, Jinson breaks national record","April 14, 2018","AFI Media
14 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). Neeraj Chopra lived up to his billing as he ended Indian athletics gold medal drought at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday. The 20-year-old clinched the gold medal in the men’s javelin throw event with an effort of 86.47m. He finished well ahead of the field with the silver medal going to Australia’s Hamish Peacock with a throw of 82.59m Grenada’s Anderson Peters took bronze with a throw of 82.20

However such was Chopra’s dominance that his three best throws of the competition  — 86.47m, 85.50 and 84.78m — would have seen him finish ahead of the second placed Peacock.  He had all but secured gold with his first throw of the competition. His mark of 85.50m was just short of his season’s best and it was clear that Chopra would only improve.  From then on, the only interest in the competition was whether Chopra could set a new national record. The old one of 86.48 also stood in his name. A foul throw was followed by 84.78 in his third effort and then the mammoth 86.47m mark in his fourth. Chopra subsequently threw 83.48 in his penultimate throw before ending with a foul throw on his final attempt.

It was a medal that had long been expected for Chopra. The 20-year-old from Khandra village, in Haryana’s Panipat district had first broken into the national reckoning when he shattered the National record with a throw of 86.48m at the World Youth Championships in 2016. He had followed up that performance with a throw of 84. To take gold at the Asian Championships the following year. While Chopra would not manage to make the finals at the 2017 World championships, his talent was never in question.

He had shown red hot form at the Federation Cup in March this year, flinging the javelin 85.63m. He would only improve on that performance at the Carrara Stadium at Gold Coast.

The other Indian finalist in the competition, Vipin Kasana, would fall short of a medal, taking fifth place with a best throw of 77.87m. It was a disappointing finish for Kasana who had thrown 78.88m during qualification round and might have expected to improve on that performance in the finals.

While Chopra finished in glory. a spectacular result was recorded in the men’s 1500m race by Jinson Johnson. The 27-year-old, clocked 3:37.86 seconds, to finish fifth in a world class field. He however managed to shatter the 23-year-old mark of 3:38:00 seconds recorded by Bahadur Singh in 1996. The result was a huge personal best for Johnson as well.

The gold medal went to Elijah Monotei Manangoi with a time of 3:34:78 seconds while Timothy Cheruiyot and Jake Wightman took silver and bronze with a time of 3:35:17 seconds and 3:35.97 seconds respectively.

The Indian day on the track though would end in disappointment with the men’s 4x400m team crashing out in the final after Amoj Jacob suffered an injury at the first baton change. The gold medal would go to Botswana with a time of 3.01.78 seconds while Bahamas and Jamaica took silver and bronze with a time of 3:01:92 seconds and 3:01:97 seconds respectively. Indian team of Amoj Jacob, J Suresh, Mohammad Anas and Arokia Rajeev had clocked 3:04:05 seconds during qualification.

The women’s 4x400m relay team too finished out of the medal range clocking 3:33:61 seconds to finish seventh.

"Youngsters Neeraj, Hima and co. set to shine at the big stage","April 5, 2018","With India beginning its journey at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Thursday, three weightlifters are expected to deliver the first medals of the campaign. While Mirabai Chanu is expected to be dominant in the women’s 48kg category, keep an eye out for Muthupandi Raja in the men’s 62kg category as well.

At 18 years and five months, Raja is the youngest of the competitors in his division. Only just last year, he was competing in the boy’s category at the Commonwealth Championships where he won a gold.

However, Raja isn’t the youngest amongst his compatriots. That would be 69-kg competitor Deepak Lather, who is two months younger, and a bronze medallist competing in the senior category at the Commonwealth Championships.

Raja and Lather are just two of several Indian athletes in their teens — 28 in all — or barely out of it, who will be competing for medals in Gold Coast. They aren’t just there to make up the numbers either. Neeraj Chopra, 20, currently holds the best throw among javelin throwers from the Commonwealth participants this year and is India’s best bet in the field events, while quartermiler Hima Das (18) will be the driving force in the women’s 4x400m team. 19-year-old Divya Kakran too will be looking to add to her gold medal in the women’s 68kg wrestling competition.

The most precocious youngsters though, are to be found in the shooting squad.

Three members of the team — Manu Bhaker, Mehuli Ghosh and Anish Bhanwala are teenagers. All of them are favoured to win their respective events. Competing in the women’s 10m pistol event, 16-year-old Manu Bhaker is the youngest Indian competitor at Gold Coast and is coming off winning two gold medals at the ISSF World Cup in Mexico. Mehuli Ghosh, 17, won a bronze at the same tournament in the women’s 10m rifle. Bhanwala, 16, is fresh off a gold medal in the men’s 25m rapid fire pistol at the World Cup in Sydney. All three were competing in their first World Cup. “A new era in Indian shooting,” was how Abhinav Bindra described those performances.

Jaspal Rana, coach of the Indian junior shooting team — no stranger to early success himself (he won a World Championship gold when he was 18) — says young athletes have an inherent advantage. “You are fresh, new and have nothing to lose. You aren’t putting any pressure on yourself at this age,” he says.

That self belief has also been noticed by Olympian and the only Indian athlete to win a World Championships medal, Anju Bobby George. “Perhaps we were more hardworking, but the youngsters you see now are more bold,” she says. She remains astounded by the success of 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar, who after being introduced to the sport by a Physical Education teacher, picked up skills essentially over YouTube, much like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra did. Shankar would go on to pack his bags and participate in collegiate athletics in the USA. “We would stick to doing only what our coaches told us. Our generation didn’t even know about such things like social media or how to use it to improve ourselves. Perhaps we wouldn’t even have thought of that,” she says.

India has had talented youngsters before. Most of them faded away, unable to carry their success into the seniors. Shooting had been a prime example of this with tales of unfulfilled promise to be found aplenty. Navnath Fartade won a junior world Championship gold in 2006 and subsequently a bronze at the Doha Asian Games, but is out of the national reckoning today.

The current generation though has it a lot smoother. Jaspal Rana believes the shift began about six years ago, when the national federation put in place a robust plan for supporting youngsters with the bulk (approximately 60 percent of funding) going towards them. “The funds are being given to the junior program. There is a proper system that’s been in place for the last six-seven years. Manu, Mehuli and Anish haven’t come up suddenly. There has been systematic training that has been responsible for their success.”

Despite the success that they have enjoyed recently, Rana says it’s best to remain cautious about their future. “We need to keep them grounded at this age. It is not fair to expect them to perform every time. You have to accept that they won’t get the results every time. In India, we have a habit of bringing them up very quickly and bringing them down very quickly.”

The youngsters themselves aren’t overthinking about the upcoming few days. “A part of me is excited that I will be competing against some of the best runners in the world,” says 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be part of the 4x400m relay squad. The team will face a tough task going against a Bahamas side that features Worlds silver medalist Steve Gardiner, a Botswana team that featured two finalists in the 400m at the World Championships and the defending relay world champion team from Trinidad and Tobago.

“There’s no point worrying about how I will perform against them. It’s a great opportunity. There’s nothing much to think about it. Thoda mauj aur phir fad do sabki (Have a little fun and then go all out),” he says.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/15-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/youngsters-neeraj-hima-and-co-set-to-shine-at-the-big-stage/,Athletics
Neeraj smashes meet record with his second best throw of career,"March 6, 2018","AFI Media
06 March 2018

Patiala. Neeraj Chopra reemphasized his position as the best javelin thrower in the country even as he won a gold medal at the Run Adam Federation Cup Senior National Athletics Championships 2018 by setting a new meet record.

In his final throw of the competition, Chopra threw the spear 85.94m, erasing the old mark of 85.63m, recorded at the same venue last year. Chopra who had already matched the AFI’s qualifying guidelines of 81.80m at the Indian Grand Prix last month, recorded what was the second best performance of his career and the best throw ever recorded on Indian soil. “Although I had already qualified for the CWG, I wanted to make a mark at the Federation Cup. That is why I was trying so hard. I will look to improve on this at the Commonwealth Games,” Neeraj said.

While Chopra had already qualified for the CWG, the Federation Cup was meant as the final opportunity for athletes to book their spots in the Indian squad. Two athletes made the most of the opportunity.

Hima Das, who turned 18 last month is primarily a 100 and 200m runner and was in fine form in the latter having won gold at the Asian Games Test event. However she was competing in the 400m and stunned the Federation Cup field in what was her debut competition in the quarter mile. Das clocked 51.97m to finish inside the CWG qualifying guidelines of 52 seconds set by the Athletics Federation of India. “I was expecting to do around 52 seconds. So when I saw that I was able to go inside 52 seconds I was very happy. I was not sure how I would run the 400m but I was able to run without any difficulty,” Das said after finishing more than a second ahead of second place GK Vijaykumari who clocked 53.03 seconds.

Shot putter Tejinder Pal Toor was the other athlete to exceed the AFI’s qualifying guidelines. Toor, who won a silver at the Asian Indoor games in January, needed just one throw to better the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 20.20m, by hurling the iron sphere 20.24m. For Toor, it was a satisfying return to the ground on which he had thrown a personal best of 20.40m last season. Back then Toor had been in the race to qualify for the 2017 World Championships but had fallen short by 10 centimetres. Despite his performance on Tuesday, Toor was not satisfied with his performance. “My goal was to throw over 21 meters. I could not do it here but I will try to do it in the Commonwealth Games,” he said.

There were other strong performances on the day too, most impressive of which was long jumper M Sreeshankar, who leaped into the junior record books with a jump of 7.99m. Although the 18-year-old Sreeshankar took the gold medal, he fell just 1 cm short of the AFI qualifying standard mark of 8.00m set for his event.

Although he fell short of the qualifying guideline of 10.16m, Siva Kumar of Tamil Nadu, marked himself as a sprinter to watch out for as he stunned a 100m field that included National Record holder Amiya Mallick and Asian Indoor bronze medalist Elakkiya Dasan to win a maiden national gold medal with a time of 10.43 seconds. Elakkiya Dasan was second with 10.56 seconds while Sanjeet of Haryana was third with a time of 10.59 seconds.

AFI to field 35-member contingent at Paris Olympic Games,"May 15, 2024","Bhubaneswar

The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) will field a 35-member contingent, including star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra to compete at the Paris Olympic Games scheduled to start July 26 in France, Adille Sumariwalla, president AFI said here on Tuesday. “Twenty athletes have achieved automatic qualification criteria set up by World Athletics. While 11 athletes will qualify through the world ranking system,” the AFI president added. “We are expecting five more athletes to make the cut for the Olympic Games before the June 30 deadline.”

At the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games held in 2021 in Japan, AFI had fielded less than 30 athletes. Asian Games and World U20 record holder, Neeraj Chopra, became the first Indian athlete to win gold in Japan.

According to Adille, AFI has also made it mandatory for Paris Olympic Games aspirants to compete at the domestic competition beginning June 27 in Panchkula before the qualification deadline of June 30. “There is no exception. All athletes will have to compete at the National Inter-State Athletics meet in Haryana to prove their fitness,” Adille said here during media interaction on the sidelines of the 27th National Federation Senior Athletics Competition.

Adille, who is also one of the vice presidents of the world governing body in track and field—World Athletics—said, Indian contingent has potential to win more than one medal at the 2024 Olympic Games. “We have good chances of winning medals in javelin, 4x400m relay and long jump if the athletes perform up to their potential on a given day,” the vice president of World Athletics added.

The Indian men and women’s 4x400m relay teams qualified for the Paris Olympic Games at the just concluded World Athletics World Relays held in Bahamas on May 4 and 5. “We are hopeful that the mixed 4x400m relay team will also make the cut in the upcoming Asian relay competition in Bangkok, Thailand,” Adille said.

The AFI president said there has been gradual progression in track and field in the country. “The Indian athletics contingent has been making the cut for the finals at global level,” he added. “At the 2023 World Athletics Championships held in Budapest, Hungary, three Indian javelin throwers were in the medal round. Neeraj Chopra went on to win the gold medal.”

Meanwhile, as expected Asian Games champion, Tajinderpal Singh Toor won gold medal in the men’s shot put event and Jeswin Aldrin dominated the men’s long jump event.

AFI has chalked out comprehensive roadmap for the Paris Olympic Games,"December 2, 2023","AFI media

Amritsar

The Athletics Federation of India has chalked out a comprehensive 2024 Paris Olympic Games plan to have a more successful innings than the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games held in 2021 in Japan. While AFI is aiming for more than one medal at the July 26 to August 11 Paris Olympic Games scheduled to be held next year in France, it has also set strict qualification criteria.

At the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games held in 2021 in Japan, India’s star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra became the first Indian to win track and field gold.

“We have had a discussion with the respective coaches this week to chalk out an international exposure tour for the core group of athletes in the buildup to the Paris Olympic Games,” Adille Sumariwalla, president, AFI said here on Saturday.

The members of the 4x400m men and women’s relay squad will go to Bahamas for a four weeks exposure tour ahead of the World Athletics Relays scheduled to be held on May 4-5 in Nassau. “Competition in the Bahamas will be one big opportunity for the Indian relay squad to qualify for the Paris Olympic Games,” Sumariwalla said on the sidelines of the AFI Annual General Meeting.

The top 14 teams at the World Athletics Relays meet in May will get an automatic berth for the Olympic Games, the AFI president added.

After a fifth-place finish with a sub-three minutes at the 2023 Budapest World Athletics Championships held in Hungary in August, the national 4x400m men’s relay team continued their good run by winning gold at the 19th Hangzhou Asian Games in China. “We are expecting good results from the men’s 4x400m relay team in the Bahamas and at the Paris Olympic Games,” Sumariwalla added.

However, it could be challenging for the women’s 4x400m and mixed 4x400m relay teams to win an automatic qualification berth for the Olympics in Bahamas. “The national camp has started and athletes have nearly five months to prepare and deliver the goods at the right time,” Sumariwalla said.

While the members of the relay team will go to Bahamas for an exposure tour, the race walker has plans to go to Turkey to achieve Paris Olympic qualification at the World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships, scheduled to be held in Antalya on April 21-22.

“Coaches in coordination with the athletes have prepared plans to peak at the right time,” the AFI president said.

The AFI has also set strict selection criteria for the Pais Olympic Games hopefuls.

Apart from achieving the Paris Olympic Games qualification standard set by the World Athletics during the qualification period, the athletes will have to perform at par with a 16th place finish in their respective events achieved at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games held in 2021, during the final selection trials in June next, Sumariwalla added.

The 63rd National Inter State Senior Athletics Championships scheduled to be held next year in Panchkula, Haryana from June 27 to 30 will be the last platform to achieve the qualification for the Olympic Games, the AFI president said. “We have set strict qualification criteria to ensure athletes repeat their home performance at the Paris Olympic Games,” Sumariwalla added.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Article-Baner-2023.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-has-chalked-out-comprehensive-roadmap-for-the-paris-olympic-games/,Athletics

Budding javelin throwers hogged the limelight on the penultimate day of the 38th National Junior Athletics Championships here at the Nehru Stadium on Thursday.

While top four finishers in the girls U14 group bettered the national record in the kids javelin competition, top two athletes were also successful in breaking the previous meet record in the boys U14 kids javelin throw event.

However, it was Himanshi from Haryana who walked away with the U14 kids javelin title. Her gold medal winning throw of 44.05m was nearly nine meters better than the previous national record of 34.46m recorded by Tejaswani Dhal in February this year in Patna.

In the boys U14 kids javelin, Bihar’s Kishu Singh won gold medal with a throw of 64.56m to erase the previous meet record of 57.08m in the name of Dhairya Alpenshbhai set in 2022.

Haryana’s Deepika also won U18 javelin throw gold with a distance of 54.13m, which was a meet record. The previous record of 49.05m was in the name of Pushpa Jakhar recorded in 2015 in Ranchi. Jharkhand.

The kids javelin event was introduced at the domestic competitions two years ago to encourage budding athletes to take up javelin. There has been a big surge in javelin throw post 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games held in Japan in 2021.

At the Tokyo Olympic Games, India’s ace javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra became the first Indian to win track and field gold. Apart from Commonwealth and Asian Games gold, Chopra is reigning Olympic and world champion too.

Bannihatti (Ballari), February 28: National Record holding Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor and Karanveer Singh, who won gold and silver medals respectively in the Asian Indoor Athletics Championships in Nur-Sultan earlier this month, will be the star attractions in the second AFI National Throws Competition at the Inspire Institute of Sports here tomorrow.

At the start of the outdoor season leading to the World Athletics Championships and the Asian Games, 28-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor will be hoping to find the form that makes him a formidable competitor at the Asian level. He will be keen to make a mark in the World Athletics Championships in Budapest in August.

Indian Athletics stayed on the growth trajectory last year, with Tokyo2020 Champion Neeraj Chopra winning the World Athletics Championships Javelin Throw silver and the Diamond League Trophy. Besides, Indian Track and Field athletes came back from the Commonwealth Games with eight medals.

Besides winning eight medals in the Asian Indoor Championships in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, there has been some good news for Indian athletics this season with walkers qualifying for the World Athletics Championships and the Olympic Games, marathon runners attaining qualifying standard for the Asian Games.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor leads the all-time Indian Shot Put list with 21.49m record that he set in Patiala in June 2021 while Karanveer Singh will want to rise from the eighth spot on that list which he achieved with a 20.10m performance in Bengaluru last year. Indrajeet Singh and Sahib Singh will want to ensure that the Shot Put competition is not a two-horse race.

Manpreet Kaur, the only Indian to breach the 18m mark in women’s Shot Put, and Manju Bala in women’s Hammer Throw are among the athletes whose performances will be watched with more than casual interest. Both topped the Indian lists in their respective events last year and will want to resume their domination.

"Amlan, Jyothi will be centre of attraction in National Open Athletics Championships","October 14, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 14: Amlan Borgohain and Jyothi Yarraji have made such waves with their speed on track in the recent times that it is natural for them to be the centre of attention ahead of the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here from tomorrow.

As recently as in the 36th National Games in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, sprinter Amlan Borgohain (Services) and 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, the Andhra Pradesh athlete who will turn out for Railways here, were scorching the track by winning a golden double each. They will have to handle the pressure of expectation in delivering quality performances here.

In the recent domestic competitions, the men’s Long Jumpers and Triple Jumpers have trained the spotlight on themselves. However, with Long Jumpers M Sreeshankar, Jeswin Alrdrin and Muhammed Anees Yahiya and Triple Jumpers Eldhose Paul, Abdulla Aboobacker and Praveen Chithravel skipping the meet, the interest around the sand pits may come down a bit.

With Tokyo2020 Javelin Throw gold medalist Neeraj Chopra and Commonwealth Games 3000m Steeplechase silver medalist Avinash Sable not featuring in the entry list, it would be up to Tajinderpal Singh Toor, now on comeback mode after an injury prevented him from going to the Shot Put circle in the World Championships in July. to shine for the experienced hands.

As many as 868 athletes from 31 teams, including four institutions, will vie for honours in the five-day competition. Being the only team with more than 100 athletes, Railways has the largest number of entries. With a 50-strong women’s squad, the most for any team, Railways has a total of 103 entries. 

Interestingly, for the first time, Services will have representation in the women’s competition, with 400m runner Summy joining the Army recently. Among the States and Union Territories, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are fielding the biggest contingents with 87 and 80 athletes respectively. Assam and Ladakh will have the smallest teams with two athletes each. 

Four finals are scheduled for the opening day with the men and women’s 20km Race Walk staring the proceedings while women Pole Vaulters, notably Rosy Meena Paulraj who set a National Record in the National Games in Gandhinagar, and Discus Throwers will be competing for medals in the afternoon.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Article-Start-List-Model-1-banner.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/amlan-jyothi-will-be-centre-of-attraction-in-national-open-athletics-championships/,Athletics

In 4x400m men’s relay team, we have replaced Rajesh Ramesh who has minor injury and could not perform as expected at the World Championships with Mohammed Anas,”
“Two female athletes are dropped from the team after they failed a dope test. We have zero tolerance for doping. I am also pleased that entry of high jumper Tejaswin Shankar has been accepted by the Games organising committee.

AFI announced 22-member squad for the World Athletics Championships Oregon22,"July 1, 2022","AFI Media

New Delhi, June 30: Olympic Games Javelin Throw gold medallist Neeraj Chopra feature in the Indian squad to compete in the World Athletics Championships Oregon22 to be held in Eugene, Oregon from July 15 to 24. Athletics Federation of India today named a 22-member, including five women, in the team.

AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said the team had been selected from among those who had either attained the entry standard set by World Athletics or qualified on the basis of their world rankings.

Seven of the 16 athletes, who will compete in individual events, are National Record holders. They include Sable, Sreeshankar, Tajinderpal Singh Toor, Neeraj Chopra, Sandeep Kumar, Annu Rani and Priyanka Goswami.

Mr. Sumariwalla said relay runner Amoj Jacob’s selection would be subject to his regaining fitness and women’s 400m sprinter Aishwarya Kailash Mishra’s selection was subject to her undergoing a fitness trial over 400m with electronic time and dope testing. “Arokia Rajiv will replace Amoj in case he does not regain fitness,” he said.

Aishwarya Mishra clocked 51.18 seconds in the Federation Cup in Kozhikode on April 3 and has not completed a lap in a competitive event since. She entered the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Chennai earlier this month but was disqualified after making a foul start in the 400m heats.

The AFI President said that Discus Thrower Seema Antil had chosen to withdraw from the World Championships as she wanted to prepare for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. “She has won medals in four Commonwealth Games and wanted to focus on the Birmingham competition,” he said.

Asked about Long Jumper Jeswin Aldrin’s exclusion, Mr. Sumariwalla said the selectors had decided not to pick him as his form was in the decline. “He attained the entry standard by jumping 8.26m in the Federation Cup on April 3 but his graph has shown only a downward trend since. He jumped 7.82, 7.69 and 7.51 in the last three meets,” he said.

When a reporter compared Jeswin Aldrin with Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, the AFI President pointed out that the Asian champion was staging a comeback from a wrist surgery and had kept improving his performances. “In the Inter-State Championships, which was a selection meet, Toor won with a 20.34m effort. He is the best we have in Shot Put,” he said.

The team:

Men: Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), MP Jabir (400m Hurdles), M Sreeshankar and Muhammed Anees Yahiya (Long Jump), Abdulla Aboobacker, Praveen Chithravel and Eldhose Paul (Triple Jump), Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Neeraj Chopra and Rohit Yadav (Javelin Throw), Sandeep Kumar (20km Race Walking), Amoj Jacob*, Noah Nirmal Tom, Muhammed Ajmal, Naganathan Pandi, Rajesh Ramesh and Muhammed Anas Yahiya (4x400m).

Women: S Dhanalakhsmi (200m), Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (400m), Parul Chaudhary (3000m Steeplechase), Annu Rani (Javelin Throw) and Priyanka Goswami (20km Walk).

Note: Amoj Jacob has been selected subject to fitness. If he is not fit, Arokia Rajiv will replace him in the relay squad. Aishwarya Kailash Mishra will be subject to a fitness trial in 400m (with electronic time and dope testing).",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AFI-announces-22-member-squad-for-oregon2022-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-announced-22-member-squad-for-the-world-athletics-championships-oregon22/,Athletics
Annu Rani improves women’s Javelin Throw National Record for Eighth Time,"May 8, 2022","AFI Media

Jamshedpur, May 8: Annu Rani (Uttar Pradesh) broke her own Javelin Throw National Record when winning the women’s title in the Tata Steel fourth AFI Indian Open Javelin Throw Competition under floodlights at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here today. She threw the spear to 63.82m, a 58cm improvement on her own mark set in Patiala on March 15, 2021.

The 29-year-old showed she has put behind the disappointment of the Olympic Games by rewriting the National Record for the eighth time since she first claimed it from Suman Devi on June 7, 2014. On Sunday night, Annu Rani took three other throws that went to 60.10m, 56.60m and 58.13m before passing the last two attempts.

In other events today, 17-year-old Yash Saini (Haryana), made a victorious debut at the National-level, winning the Boys U18 crown with a string of consistent throws. His 67.42m is the second best throw by an Indian U18 lad since September 2019. Vivek Kumar (Madhya Pradesh), a Boys U20 silver medallist in the last edition in New Delhi, claimed gold this time with a 68.67m effort. Delhi’s Disha won the Girls U16 event with a best throw of 34.87m.

Son of policeman, Yash Saini decided to overcome a slight headwind and a niggle in the elbow by taking a leaf out of Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic campaign – a masterly opening throw.

His maiden throw in a National-level competition was the one that ensured him the title compares favourably with his State-mate Sujit’s 68.38m effort which was the best achieved by an Indian U18 thrower last year. Yash followed up his first throw with efforts of 65.21, 63.24, 64.05 and 65.46m before easing off with a 57.85m final throw.

“I was hoping to throw with an international Javelin. I have thrown 72m in training and would have been happy if I had matched that but considering the slight wind blowing towards us and my niggle, I am happy that I won gold on debut. I have been training for three years but it is only now that my coaches Arvind Kumar and Dharmender believed I was ready,” he said.

Nearly 100 Javelin Throwers will vie for National honours in eight categories,"October 22, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, October 22: Nearly 100 Javelin Throwers have registered to compete in eight categories in the third AFI National Open Javelin Throw Championships at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here this weekend. The competition is the last of the 14 National-level competitions conducted by the Athletics Federation of India this year.

With seven of the country’s best Javelin Throwers in the ongoing National camp and six others attending the Assessment Camp in the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports, Patiala, the National Championships offer a good opportunity for the others to not only win medals but also catch the eye of the talent scouts.

“Neeraj Chopra’s gold medal in the Olympic Games earlier this year has sparked keen interest in Javelin Throw among youngsters, but it is too early for that to translate as more entries in national-level competitions, especially at a time when the pandemic has made it difficult for athletes to train,” Athletics Federation of India President Adille J. Sumariwalla said.

More boys and girls vying for honours in the U18 and U16 categories here than in the Javelin Throw events in the National Junior Championships in Guwahati earlier this year. “It is pleasing to note that more and more youth are drawn to athletics and prepare themselves to compete at the highest level in the country,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

“It has been AFI’s endeavour to offer quality competition experience to all our athletes and by streaming them live on the Web. I am glad we have been able to go through the full quota of national-level competitions, except the National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet, this year against all odds,” he said. “Our resolve to make athletics more popular has only got stronger.”",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Article.png,https://indianathletics.in/nearly-100-javelin-throwers-will-vie-for-national-honours-in-eight-categories/,Athletics
"AFI Decides to Redesign Junior Programme, provide more Competitions","September 13, 2021","AFI Media

Jaipur, September 13: In a major decision, Athletics Federation of India today decided that it would redesign and strengthen its junior programme to be able to build on the gains of Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic Games gold medal and the three-medal haul in the World Athletics U20 Championships.

At its two-day Executive Council meeting here, AFI resolved to support juniors in events like 400m, Javelin Throw, Long Jump, Triple Jump and Race Walking. “We want our Juniors Athletes to have strong foundation and provide them more competitions,” AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla told reporters. “It will be a boost for the Junior Programme that AFI launched three decades ago. In order to give our athletes more competition in the preparatory stage, we will conduct Zonal level meets.”

Stating that the thrust will be in these events, the AFI President said that the Council had also decided to widen the talent identification process. “Apart from our flagship National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet, which is the world’s largest talent search programme, we will go the extra mile and identify talent out of competitions,” he said.

He revealed that the Executive Council had reviewed the performance of the athletes and coaches in the Olympic Games and made some decisions, including rope in two new coaches for Javelin Throw and coaches for Shot Put and Long Jump.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot said the Federation had carried out in depth analysis of the performance of athletes and coaches in the Olympic Games. “Neeraj Chopra was consistent and deservedly won the gold medal. Discus thrower Kamalpreet did well despite not having adequate international exposure. She is capable of doing much better,” he said.

“The men’s relay team did well to set a new Asian Record, though it had the capability of clocking 2:57. The squad needed higher level competition in the run up to the Olympic Games but the second wave of Covid-19 affected our plans. Steeplechaser Avinash Sable created a National Record despite having to recover from Covid-19. Lack of international competitions affected our performance,” he said.

“Our coaches will work with the foreign coaches who have the latest knowledge,” he said, pointing out that the Federation is working towards raising the level of Indian coaches.

"Shaili Singh bags Long Jump silver, India enjoys best show in WAU20 Championships","August 22, 2021","AFI Media

Nairobi, August 22: Shaili Singh claimed the women’s Long Jump silver medal in the World Athletics U20 Championships here on Sunday. Her slight wind-aided effort of 6.59m was only 1cm short of the gold medal jump by Sweden’s Maja Askag but her silver medal ensured that Indian athletics continues to showcase the progress it has been making.

Until this edition, India had won a total of four medals in the World Athletics Junior Championships, with bronze medals for Discus Thrower Seema Antil (2002) and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon (2014) and gold medals for Javelin Thrower Neeraj Chopra (2016) and 400m runner Hima Das (2018). India has nearly matched that tally here.

Shaili Singh’s was India’s third medal in the World Athletics U20 Championships here, coming after the bronze won by the Mixed Team in the 4x400m Relay and the silver by Amit Khatri in the men’s 10,000m Race Walk. India finished 21st on the medal table, aware that a gold would have lifted it to the top 15.

Having started with two jumps of 6.34m, Shaili Singh shot into the lead after three rounds when she leapt to 6.59m, with the aid of a slight tail wind. But Sweden’s Maja Askag stole that position with her fourth jump that measured just 1cm more. The Indian tried hard but fouled two attempts and then had a 6.37m on her final try to regain pole position.

Earlier, Donald Makirmairaj was in bronze medal position when he logged in 15.70m on his second try but was soon crowded out of the podium reckoning. He fought back with a personal best leap of 15.82m on his fifth attempt, 6cm more than his previous best. Jumping into a slight headwind, he finished just 3cm short of Frenchman Simon Gore’s bronze medal winning effort.

Gallant efforts by Summy and Priya Habbanathahalli Mohan in the second and anchor legs lifted the Indian women’s 4x400m relay squad from fifth place to a creditable fourth in a time of 3:40.45. They both had sub-54 second split times, being credited with 53.75 and 53.38, and tried to balance the efforts of Payal Vohra (57.28) and Rajitha Kunja (56.04).

Ankita Dhyani finished sixth in the gruelling women’s 5000m in a time of 17:17.68, as she bravely took the challenge presented to distance runners by the altitude of Nairobi. She stuck with the leaders – the only non-African in the bunch of six – till the 3000m mark.

This is your moment to shine: Sebastian Coe,"August 22, 2021","For India, with its massive population, offers immense potential for athletics to get bigger and more popular.

“I love watching you guys perform and this is a country that is really making great progress,” said Coe, the president of World Athletics and a middle distance legend, when he met the Indian 4x400m mixed relay that won the bronze at the under-20 Worlds in Nairobi.

“You had a great triumph in Tokyo (Olympics), so this is your moment to shine on the stage.”

Working magic

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra’s stunning Olympic gold has already begun to work its magic on Indian athletes, it has made them bolder.

“Before Neeraj’s show, we used to think that Indians can’t do well (at the world level) but now we are confident of showing that we are a lot better than many other countries,” said Bharath Sridhar, the mixed team’s lead-leg runner from Villupuram in Tamil Nadu who bounced back from a ligament injury to on his left ankle to help the country produce a memorable bronze on Wednesday.

Bengaluru’s Priya H. Mohan, the country’s fastest quartermiler this year, felt Neeraj’s gold has made athletes stronger.

“When Neeraj won, we also thought we have to follow in his steps and win many more medals so that athletics becomes a main sport in India which will bring a lot more support,” said Priya who also entered the individual 400m final apart from sparkling in the bronze-medal show.

The last few weeks have shown the emergence of a new India, said Adille Sumariwalla.

“What we are seeing now is a new India, a confident India and Neeraj has done the trick,” said the president of the Athletics Federation of India.

‘As good as our seniors’

“The (under-20 mixed relay team’s) 3:20.60s is nearly as fast as our seniors ran (3:19.93) in Tokyo. This goes to show the depth of our junior program, our inter-district programme, and that our juniors are capable of competing with seniors and it’s just a matter of time that we will be getting more and more medals,” said Sumariwalla.

“And our job as a federation is to create enough bench strength so that any point we can change runners, we can substitute runners. If somebody gets injured, we can seamlessly substitute them and that is most important for me.”

Barath Sridhar, Priya Mohan, Summy and Kapil clocked 3:20.60 behind Nigeria (3:19.70) and Poland (3:19.80) to post a creditable time and gave a glimpse of the depth of India’s talent in the quartermile event.

The Indian quartet – with Abdul Razak Rasheed running the lead leg – had clocked 3:23.36 in the heats in the morning. Priya and Summy ran their women’s 400m heats not long after that.

"Seema Antil breaks two-decade-old record, books berth in Tokyo2020 with 63.72m throw","June 29, 2021","Patiala, June 29: Seema Antil (Uttar Pradesh) qualified for the discus throw competition in the Olympic Games in Tokyo with a 63.72m throw on the final day of the Fast&Up 60th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Tuesday. She became the 12th individual Indian athlete to qualify for Tokyo2020.

Having reached Patiala from Belarus in the wee hours of June 27, the 37-year-old went past the 60m mark on four of her five legal throws, going close to the Olympic Qualifying mark of 63.50m with her third effort of 63.18m that was a new meet record before finding the power to breach the Olympic standard with her fourth try.

Without a world ranking since she was nursing a glutes injury, Seema Antil was taking part in only her third competition since the 2018 Asian Games. She threw 62.64m in ṭhe Federation Cup here in March and after managing 58.62 in Minsk on June 25, she secured her ticket to the fourth Olympic Games with her first throws over 63m since August 7, 2004 in Kiev.

“I know I can throw farther with my training but I was wary of aggravating the issue with my glutes muscles. I have worked hard over the last two and half years since the Asian Games and am happy that I could secure qualification today. I will consult the Athletics Federation of India and draw up my training programme for the Olympic Games,” she said.

Besides the 4x400m mixed relay squad,  Avinash Sable (men’s 3000m Steeplechase), Tajinderpal Singh Toor (men’s Shot Put), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (men’s Javelin Throw), M Sreeshankar (men’s Long Jump), Kamalpreet Kaur (women’s Discus Throw) and race walkers KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (men) and Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (women) have already qualified for the Olympic Games.

There is expectation that some others like MP Jabir (men’s 400m Hurdles), Dutee Chand (women’s 200m), Annu Rani (women’s Javelin Throw) will make it on the strength of their world ranking. Besides if the men and women’s relay teams, ranked 13 and 16 on the Road to Olympic Games list at the time of writing, may raise the size of the Indian athletics team.

With World Athletics responding positively to the Athletics Federation of India request to consider the 3:01.89 clocked in the 4x400m heats on Friday, the men’s team was restored to the 13th place ahead of Germany, Poland and Czech Republic. It let the men’s team to rest Amoj Jacob and run a relaxed race today.

Running with a changed combination after Hima Das pulled out, the Indian women’s 4x100m relay squad of AK Daneshwari, Archana Suseendran, S Dhanalakshmi and Dutee Chand had to content itself with a new meet record time of 44.15 seconds, short of its target (43.03 seconds) that would have earned it a berth in the Olympic Games.

Hima Das tried gamely to compete in the women’s 200m final, chasing 22.80 seconds to qualify, but finished fifth in 25.03 seconds. PD Anjali (Kerala) and Lovepreet Singh (Punjab) were the winners of the women’s and men’s 200m sprints in 24.01 seconds and 21.04 seconds respectively.

New Delhi, April 6: Athletics Federation of India has on Tuesday named a 20-member squad of athletes, including seven women 100m runners, to compete in the World Athletics Relays Silesia21 in the Silesian Stadium in Chorzow, Poland, on May 1 and 2. It will be the first major international event for the sprinters since the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha in April 2019.

“We are excited to get our athletes ready for their first international competition after the Covid-induced gap. We are glad the team will spend time in training in Turkey before it reaches Chorzow of the World Athletics Relays,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said.

“We were able to organise meets in NIS Patiala in February and March so that our athletes had a feel of competition.”

The AFI President said the coaching staff was confident that the athletes would be ready to deliver their best performance. “The Federation has done everything in its power to enable the athletes stay healthy and train through the lockdown and beyond and be ready for international competition,” he said.

Mr. Sumariwalla said AFI was happy that its focus on women’s 100m sprinters in National camps has paid off. “With S Dhanalakshmi emerging on the scene in the Federation Cup last month, she and Dutee Chand are two Indian runners who have run sub-11.50 times this season. We believe the 4x100m women’s team with Dhanalakshmi, Dutee, Hima Das and Archana Suseendran can come up with a good effort,” he said.

Discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur uncorks National Record throw to secure Olympic berth,"March 19, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 19: Kamalpreet Kaur’s one legal throw in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships on Friday rewrote the women’s Discus Throw National Record and claimed her a spot in the Olympic Games competition to be held in Tokyo later this year. Her 65.06m opening effort did the trick for her, producing the fourth National Record in five days.

With a sustained burst of speed, Hima Das (Assam) with a time of 23.21 seconds left S Dhanalakhsmi (23.39s) and Archana Suseendran (23.60s) fighting for the silver medal in the high-profile women’s 200m final. K Elakkiadasan claimed the mens 200m while Ayyasamy Dharun and R Vithya Ramraj won the men and women’s 400m Hurdles to ease Tamil Nadu contingent’s pain somewhat.

On a day when the men’s Triple Jump competition saw an intense battle, with Karthik Unnikrishnan producing a last-ditch 16.73m and Abdulla managing a 16.59 on his last try to push their Kerala team-mate Eldhose Paul to the third place with a best 16.53m that he had got on his second jump, it was Kamalpreet Kaur’s solitary throw that stole the limelight.

The 25-year-old from Badal in Punjab was not overawed by the presence of the 2014 Asian Games champion Seema Punia. Nor did Kamalpreet Kaur did not let the fact that she had a couple of 60m-plus behind her affect her. The earlier such throws came in the 2018 Inter-Railway Championships in Lucknow (61.04m) and the 2019 Federation Cup here (60.25m).

With Seema Punia coming up a no mark on her opening throw, Kamalpreet could enter the fray without training on her mind on a target distance but only focused on giving her best. She wound herself up well and unleashed the biggest throw by an Indian woman, surpassing the National record that has stood at 64.76m in the name of Krishan Poonia since 2012.

Seema Punia, who has won a medal in each of her four Commonwealth Games appearances and has two Asian Games medals, fought hard to mark her return to competition after the 2018 Asian Games with a victory. She came up with four throws in excess of 60.50m but her best was the 62.64m that she managed on her fifth attempt.

Kamalpreet this became the 10th Indian to secure the Tokyo Olympic Games athletics qualification mark laid down by World Athletics. Of course, the Mixed team in the 4x400m relay has also secured a berth in the Tokyo Games. Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Dutee Chand (100m) and Annu Rani (Javelin Throw) can get into the Olympic competition by virtue of their World ranking.

Those who had booked their Olympic tickets earlier include Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (20km Race Walk), M Sreeshankar (Long Jump), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (Javelin Throw) among the men, Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (20km Race Walk) among women.

Federation Cup offers platform for Indians to showcase evolution ahead of Tokyo Olympics,"March 14, 2021","AFI Media 

Patiala, March 14: An air of expectation is in evidence at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex as it hosts the ageasFederal Life Insurance 24th Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships from Monday. As many as 643 athletes have registered for the 38 events in the five-day meet that will offer an indication of the enthusiasm and evolution of the country’s best track and field stars.

With the postponed Tokyo Olympic Games, scheduled to start on July 23 this year, a number of athletes will be looking to consolidate their rankings with good performances here, if not to attain qualifying marks. For the likes of Steeplechaser Avinash Sable and Javelin Thrower Neeraj Chopra, the Federation Cup would be a platform too chisel the rough edges further.

The three Indian Grand Prix meets (February 18, 25 and March 5) built the stage for the Federation Cup championships. Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra’s new National Record (88.07m) on March 5, long jumper M Sreeshankar’s 8.05m effort the previous week and sprinter Dutee Chand’s comfortable victories in the 100m in the first two meets were the highlights.

Of the four finals on the opening day, the women’s 10000m and javelin throw events will hold greater attention of fans and connoisseurs alike. Long distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav will return to national-level track competition after serving a two-year sanction. She will be up against 2019 South Asian Games silver medalist Kavita Yadav, Arati Patil and a crop of younger competitors.

In the past couple of years, India’s top woman javelin thrower Annu Rani has had precious little competition, but she will try and dig deep within her reserves to match the Olympic qualification standard of 64.00. She has embraced consistency, only rarely not producing a throw in excess of 60m. It has taken her to the World No. 12 ranking.

Away from the finals, there will be considerable interest in Dutee Chand’s quest to stop the clock inside the 11.15-second mark that would secure automatic qualification for the Olympic Games in Tokyo. Sreeshankar will feature in the Long Jump qualifying while Asian Games 800m gold medalist Manjit Singh will return to competition after nearly two years when he runs the 1500m.

Besides, the availability, form and fitness of the men and women’s 400m runners will also evoke more than cursory attention. Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv, Dharun Ayyasamy will all showcase their prowess in the two rounds for men on Monday while the women’s first round heats will offer some important pointers.

The Standard Operating Procedures, laid down by the Athletics Federation of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, will be in force. Competitors, who are expected to have a RTPCR Negative Report, are being allowed entry into the NIS Campus only two hours before their respective events.

With no spectators being allowed in the NIS Campus, AFI will facilitate the live streaming of events on its YouTube channel so that fans have a ringside view of the competition.

AFI Planning Committee asks athletes to take advantage of Olympic Postponement,"April 13, 2020","13 April 2020

New Delhi. The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) Planning Committee held an online meeting with the national campers, coaches and support staff on Monday and urged all the athletes to stay mentally strong during the ongoing Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic situation and use the opportunity of Olympic postponement to their advantage.

As most of the elite athletes including the likes of javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, quarter-miler Hima Das, shot putter Tajinder Toor, race walker KT Irfan and India’s men 4x400m men and women relay team members are currently training indoors in their rooms at various national camps during lockdown, the AFI Planning Committee encouraged athletes to maintain their physical fitness and strictly follow their diet charts.

AFI President, Adille J Sumariwalla, told athletes, “We are really glad that all of you are fit and safe at the camps in Patiala, Bengaluru and Ooty. With Olympics 2020 being postponed to 2021 and World Championships, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games scheduled to take place in 2022, it will be a tough challenge for you all. We have to use this opportunity of delay to our advantage and you have to be mentally prepared for these challenges from today itself. With the changed scenario and back to back major events planned for next two years, we will have to adapt to single phase of competition period,”

“We will try to resume our domestic competitions from September-October 2020 and for next year from March-April 2021. With the postponement of Olympics, we hope that now many young athletes also stand a chance to qualify for the Olympics 2021 while seniors need to focus on their existing fitness to grab this opportunity. At this stage we cannot say anything about any foreign exposure camp later in the year, but for sure, we will plan for international competitions-cum-training camps for 2021. We are monitoring the situation at the camps and when the situation allows, you will be allowed to train outside after the consultation with SAI,” he said.

The online meeting was attended by more than 50 athletes and around 30 members of coaching team along with AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K Bhanot, National Chief Coach Bahadur Singh, Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair and Volker Hermann, AFI High Performance Director.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/advantage-of-olympic-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-planning-committee-asks-athletes-to-take-advantage-of-olympic-postponement/,Athletics
Improved Shivpal Singh Attains Tokyo 2020 Qualifying Standard With 85.47M Throw,"March 11, 2020","New Delhi, March 11: Shivpal Singh became the fifth Indian athlete and the second javelin thrower after Neeraj Chopra to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games when he hurled the spear over a distance of 85.47m in the ACNW League Meeting at Potchefstroom in South Africa on Tuesday. World Athletics has set the qualification standard at 85.00m.

 

“I am very relieved that I have been able to secure the qualification standard after missing out on a few occasions. My best throw came a few days before the qualifying period started and I went past the 83m at the World Military Games in Wuhan and the South Asian Games in Kathmandu,” he said from Potchefstroom,

 

The 24-year-old Shivpal Singh  had finished second in the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha with a personal best throw of 86.23m but that came a few days before the qualifying period kicked in on May 1, 2019. The 85.47m effort on Tuesday, which came on his fifth attempt in Potchefstroom, is his second best throw.

 

Shivpal Singh, who has been training under coach Uwe Hohn’s watchful eyes in Potchefstroom, kept improving with each throw on Tuesday, his series reading 79.97, 78.68, 79.33 and 81.50 before he unleashed the throw that went past the Olympic qualifying standard. The World No. 16 did not pass the final attempt and hit the turf past the 81m mark yet again.

 

“I will now focus on preparing for the coming competitions like the Diamond League and the Olympic Games this year. To be honest, yesterday was a part of my training schedule but I am glad I found the rhythm to keep improving with each throw. I can sense that I have improved on all fronts – strength, technique, power,” Shivpal Singh said.

 

The 20-year-old Arshdeep Singh had a best throw of 75.02m to finish third in the meet behind Shivpal Singh and Finland’s Toni Kusela, who managed to throw the javelin 80.14m with his only legal throw in three attempts. Annu Rani, India’s leading women’s javelin thrower and world No. 13, won the women’s competition with a best of 61.15m on her last attempt for her third best throw.

 

The others who have attained the Tokyo 2020 qualification marks are 20km walkers KT Irfan and Bhawna Jat as well as 3000m steeplechaser Avinash Sable. Besides, the Indian 4x400m mixed relay squad as also ensured qualification when it reached the final of the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha in September last.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SHIV-PAL-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/improved-shivpal-singh-attains-tokyo-2020-qualifying-standard-with-85-47m-throw/,Athletics
Bhawana Jat breaches Olympic qualification mark with National record,"February 15, 2020","AFI Media

Ranchi, February 15: Bhawana Jat’s elation at the finish was writ as large on her face as her determination as she won the women’s 20km race walk in the 7th National Race Walking Championships here on Saturday, with a National record that enabled her breach the qualification standard for the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Her time of 1:29:54.00 not only improved Baby Sowmya’s National Record time of 1:31:29.00 set in Delhi two year ago but also was six seconds below the Olympic qualification standard laid down by World Athletics. Uttar Pradesh’s Priyanka Goswami was 36 seconds shy of the qualification mark.

The 23-year-old became the first Indian woman athlete to meet the qualifying standard for the Olympic Games in Tokyo later this year. KT Irfan (men’s 20km walk) , Avinash Sable (3000m steeplechase) and Neeraj Chopra (javelin throw) are the first three Indians to attain qualifying standards for Tokyo 2020.

Bhawana Jat, whose first taste of victory came in the National Open Championship here in October last, said her she had trained to finish sooner. “I put in a lot of hard work in training over the last three months and wanted to come home in 1:28-1:29,” she said. “I am grateful to my parents for always supporting me & to my department (Indian Railways).”

Trailing Priyanka Goswami by a second at the 1km-mark and waking abreast of her Railway colleague at the 2km-mark, she stayed in front after opening up a 9-second lead at the 4km-mark.

Priyanka Goswami, who was runner up to Sowmya Baby in Chennai last year, had to settle for second place again once she realised that Bhawana Jat was in great form and could not be matched. Also, with the Olympic qualification standard out of her reach, she trained her focus on finishing the distance in her personal best time.

Sandeep Kumar won the men’s race quite comfortably, leading from the start to finish. He was a bit disappointed that despite his best effort, the Olympic qualification standard was still 34 seconds farther from him. “If I am selected for Asian Championships in Japan next month, I will try to improve the time and try to qualify for Tokyo2020,” he said.

KT Irfan, who was in the bunch trailing Sandeep Kumar by a minute at the halfway stage, pulled out, leaving Rahul (Haryana), Vikash Singh (Delhi) and Ganapathi Krishnan (Tamil Nadu) to fight for the second place. It was in the final 3km that Rahul pulled away from Vikash Singh to be able to claim the runner-up slot.

Men’s 20km: 1. Sandeep Kumar (Haryana) 1:21:34.00; 2. Rahul (Haryana) 1:21:59.00; 3. Vikash Singh (Delhi) 1:22:27.00.

Women’s 20km: 1. Bhawana Jat (Rajasthan) 1:29:54.00 (New National Record. Old: 1:31:29.00, Baby Sowmya, New Delhi, 2018); 2. Priyanka Goswami (Uttar Pradesh) 1:31:36.00; 3.

AFI to identify 600 athletes at MILO NIDJAM for holistic training: Volker Hermann,"November 21, 2019","Tirupati, November 21: The MILO National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet 2019 will be the platform from which the Athletics Federation of India’s plans for the 2028 and 2032 Olympic Games will be launched, AFI High Performance Director Volker Herrmann has said. “With athletes from over 500 districts taking part here, we will some exciting, finding raw talent.”


He said 600 boys and girls would be identified for training, most likely at various academies across the country. “Some of these could go on to represent India in the Olympic Games in 2028 and 2032. We are sure we will have athletes competing in a number of events then,” he said, indicating that a scientific approach would be used to assess the talent.

He said that in addition to their performances, athletes will be assessed on the basis of some tests before they are selected to undergo training. “Besides their physical parameters like height and weight, AFI will test them on the basis of two 20m runs, a long jump and a ball throw,” he said. “These will give us an indication about the abilities of the under-14 and under-16 athletes.”

Volker Herrmann said that the idea is to get all the semifinalists in track events and the finalists in field events to undergo these tests. “Besides, a number of experienced coaches and talent scouts will also nominate some athletes for these tests,” he said. “These athletes are at the right age to be tested for their abilities.”

“We are aware that some of the athletes are able to do well at the youth levels but are unable to replicate that in the senior levels. I believe we can change that by shifting the focus away from early specialisation to a variety of motor-skills,” he said. “I also know that it can happen only with the support of parents and grass-roots coaches.”

The AFI High Performance Director said it was important to help young athletes imbibe the right fundamentals. “It is best to groom a new generation of athletes in a holistic way,” Herrmann said. “Coaches must help athletes do the right things at the right age. I am happy that a number of young Indian coaches are getting themselves ready to do this.”

Neeraj Chopra, IAAF World junior Javelin Throw champion, and World University Games 100m champion Dutee Chand are among those who used earlier NIDJAM editions to showcase their potential. A couple of years ago, Lucknow’s Shailee Singh caught coach Bobby George’s eye and has evolved from a 4.93m long jumper in 2017 to owning the National junior record at 6.15m now.

The MILO NIDJAM 2019 will see as many as 30 finals, 10 each for boys and girls in the under-16 age-group and five each for boys and girls in the under-14 group. More than 4500 athletes from nearly 500 districts around the country will compete in the 17th edition of AFI’s he flagship talent search programme.

MILO NIDJAM set to host record 4500 athletes from 494 districts,"November 19, 2019","AFI Media

Tirupati, November 19: More than 4500 boys and girls in the under-16 and under-14 age-groups from a record 494 districts will compete in the MILO National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet 2019 to be held at the Sri Venkateswara University Stadium here from Saturday. It promises to be the biggest of the 17 editions of the competition.

For the record, the 2018 edition held at the same venue saw 4135 athletes from 414 districts while the year before had 4283 athletes from 424 districts competing for honours in Visakhapatnam. With Nestle-Milo coming on board this year as the title sponsor, MILO NIDJAM is poised to take track and field sport to the next level.

Athletics Federation of India President Adille Sumariwalla said AFI is delighted that its persistent efforts to galvanise district associations were paying dividends. “We have always encouraged our State units and the district associations to support the raw talent at the grass-root level so that it finds expression on this big platform,” he said.

“We are sure it will not be long before we have close to 600 of India’s 731 districts taking part in MILO NIDJAM. We will work towards getting more participation from the States in the North East,” Mr. Sumariwalla said. “Our initiative of providing financial aid to 100 districts this year has been well received and we are hoping to extend it to all districts soon.”

The AFI President said MILO NIDJAM is its flagship event and its takes pride in the fact that it is a unique talent search programme. “It is wonderful to be able to offer close to 50000 youngsters across the country the opportunity to showcase their athletic skills in the National meet. At MILO NIDJAM, our coaches and scouts are able to identify the best for grooming,” he said.

Given the magnitude of the event, AFI restricts the number of entries from each district to 12 athletes. “It does two things. It not only ensures that there is some form of quality control in that each team will pick the 12 most deserving athletes to travel to Tirupati but also enables the host to plan logistics for a manageable number of athletes and officials,” the AFI President said.

MILO NIDJAM has come a long way from the first edition held in 2003 in Hardiwar and has served as one of the earliest platforms for stars like Neeraj Chopra, Dutee Chand and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon. It is now one of the largest talent search competitions, involving more than 50000 boys and girls in the two age-groups across the country.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MILO-NIDJAM-set-to-host-record-4500-athletes-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/milo-nidjam-set-to-host-record-4500-athletes-from-494-districts/,Athletics
National Open Athletics in Ranchi likely to see high standard of competition,"October 9, 2019","National Open Athletics in Ranchi likely to see high standard of competition

                                                                                                                     

AFI Media

Ranchi, October 9: The presence of a number of India stars in the 59th National Open Athletics Championships 2019 at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium here is expected to raise the quality of competition. The spotlight will be on javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, sprinters Muhammed Anas Yahiya and VK Vismaya, long jumper Sreeshankar, metric miler Jinson Johnson, woman javelin thrower Annu Rani, sprinter Dutee Chand as well as shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, to name a few.

 

At the start of the new season, leading up to the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year, the meet will be an opportunity for Indian athletes to not only perform well and secure ranking points but also try and match the stiff qualification standards set by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

 

Inevitably, there will be the most interest in tracking Neeraj Chopra’s return to competition. He has not taken part in a championship in more than a year since throwing 83.90m in the Services Athletics Championships in Jalahalli on September 19 last year. He was training in Potchefstroom, South Africa, when it was diagnosed that his elbow injury needed surgery in May last.

 

With the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year being less than 10 months away, Neeraj Chopra’s return will hold the biggest interest among fans. As India’s premier athlete who won gold in the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games last year, the 21-year-old will be keen to show that his rehabilitation has progressed on expected lines.

 

“I really went to get back to the competition mode and since this is the last competition of the season, I want to use this competition to get into that feeling of competition. I had spoken to my doctors and they have said I am okay to compete,”

 

“I am feeling good. Much better now. I started training in Patiala few weeks back and throws are going well in training,” said Neeraj Chopra from Patiala.

 

There is belief that the men and women’s 400m races will be close since those who have been training overseas and competed for India in events like the IAAF World Relay Challenge in Yokohama and the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha. It will also be a chance for others trying to get into the National squad to display their mettle.

 

Meanwhile, the Athletics Federation of India has rejected the entries of 46 athletes, including 37 men and 9 women, who were seeking to represent Manipur despite not belonging to that State. At its annual general meeting in Agra earlier this year, the Federation had warned all States not to encourage such practices.

 

Besides, a number of athletes from Karnataka have been accommodated as AFI entries since the Federation had decided to suspend the Karnataka Athletics Association for delaying the intimation to not host the National Open in Bengaluru due to the non-availability of the Sree Kanteerava Stadium.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-450-720-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/national-open-athletics-in-ranchi-likely-to-see-high-standard-of-competition/,Athletics
Indian athletes will look to make impact on Global Stage,"September 27, 2019","Doha (Qatar), September 26: Metric miler Jinson Johnson and the 4x400m mixed relay team will lead the Indian challenge in the IAAF World Athletics Championships, the most competitive of sporting events with 2043 athletes representing 210 countries and territories, at the Khalifa Stadium here from Friday.

 

The 27-member Indian squad will be looking to turn in performances that will reflect the Athletics Federation of India’s vision of rising above continental meets and making an impact at the global level. They are well aware that it entails a lot of hard work besides remaining injury-free. Their hunger and commitment will be on display in the 10-day event.

 

The expectations from Jinson Johnson are built on the foundation of his good run recently in Berlin where he clocked a National record time of 3:35.24. He has trained at high altitude in Colorado Springs since then and can be expected to race well in the World Championships. The 4x400m mixed relay team will seek to justify the immense faith show in the squad.

 

There is no doubt that India will feel the absence of two of its leading athletes, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and 400m sprinter Hima Das. Both have the experience of winning gold at the World Junior Championships, but injuries have kept them out of the World Championships here. Yet, the morale of the squad is high as each athlete will attempt to give his or her best.

 

Long jumper M Sreeshankar will be the first Indian on view in the World Championships, taking part in the qualification round on Friday. He had qualified for the meet with an 8.20m effort in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneswar last year but has spent time in rehabilitation after picking up a heel injury. He cleared 8.00m in the Indian Grand Prix in Patiala last month.

MP Jabir and Ayyasamy Dharun, entered in the men’s 400m Hurdles, are be the other Indians slated to be view on the opening day of competition. Of course, Dharun has not taken part in a hurdles race since the Federation Cup in Patiala in March, having only recently returned to track after an injury. The race experience is expected to stand him in good stead.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/India-Team-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indian-athletes-will-look-to-make-impact-on-global-stage/,Athletics
AFI names 25-member squad for the IAAF World Championships,"September 9, 2019","New Delhi, September 8: The Athletics Federation of India selection committee on Monday picked a 25-member national team including 16 men and nine women for the IAAF World Championships to be held in Doha, Qatar, from September 27 to October 6. With less than a year to go for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the well-prepared squad will carry the hopes of the track and field fans of the country.

 

The AFI believes that the 4x400m relay teams will all perform better than they did in the World Relays in Yokohama in May last. “We have invested a lot of time in the 400m runners, getting them to train under renowned coach Galina Bukharina. We believe that the squad has been well prepared to deliver the best results on the World stage,” AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla said.

 

Metric miler Jinson Johnson, who is now training with Coach Scott Simmons in Colarado Springs, United States of America, has caught the eye with his consistency. In the recent months, he improved his own National record in the 1500m twice, first with a time of 3:37.62 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, on June 15 and then 3:35.24 in Berlin on September 1 to make the grade.

 

Long jumper M Sreeshankar, among the first Indians to attain the IAAF qualifying standard with a leap of 8.20m in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneswar in September last year, has regained form after a heel injury kept him away from the Asian Championships in Doha in April. He recently found the 8.00m mark again and will gain from competing in the big stage.

 

While 400m runner Arokia Rajiv is unavailable due to injury, the selectors decided to discuss the case of javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra who is undergoing rehabilitation programme after an elbow surgery at a later stage.Selection committee also approved the names of sprinters Dutee Chand (100m Women), ArchanaSuseentran (200m Women) and high jumper Tejaswin Shankar subject to invitation from IAAF based on their world rankings. The committee also decided to conduct confirmatory trial for quarter miler Anjali Devi for selection in the team in individual women’s 400m. The trial will be conducted on 21st September 2019 at NS-NIS Patiala. 

 

The AFI selection committee meeting, chaired by Olympian Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, was attended by AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla, Chief Coach Bahadur Singh, Bahadur Singh Saggu, Krishna Poonia, Praveen Jolly,UdayPrabhu, Paramjit Singh. Former Chief Coach JS Saini and Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair were special invitees.

 

The team:

Hon’ble Sports Minister Rijiju unveils Nestle Milo NIDJAM logo,"August 23, 2019","AFI Media

Delhi, 23rd August 2019:In what is a watershed moment in India’s sporting ecosystem, Hon. Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports, Govt. of India, Shri. Kiren Rijiju today unveiled Nestle Milo’s association as a title sponsor to NIDJAM (National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet) – one of the world’s largest talent hunt programmes for a single sport, with over 50,000 young athletes participating in it every year to qualify for the finals.

Speaking at the unveil, Shri. Kiren Rijiju said, “At a time when Government of India under the leadership of Hon. Prime Minister is getting set to launch the game-changing initiative “The Fit India Movement”, it is heartening to know corporate entities are backing a talent hunt initiative that involves young athletes from nearly 500 districts of India. NIDJAM will be a good model for all other disciplines to follow as well. I congratulate the AFI on their good work and I am certain this partnership with Nestle Milo will further strengthen the program and its outcome will be visible to all.”

The initiative is a platform for boys and girls in the Under-14 and Under-16 age groups to showcase their talent across 10 athletics disciplines. NIDJAM in the past has unearthed champions like Neeraj Chopra, Dutee Chand, Navjeet Kaur Dhillon and V Subha.

Present at the unveil was Dr. Narinder Dhruv Batra, President IOA, who congratulated the AFI and wished NIDJAM 2019 success.

AFI President Adille Sumariwalla welcomed Nestle-Milo as the Title Sponsor of the flagship AFI NIDJAM, “It will be right to say that NIDJAM can be an important part of the Fit India Movement that Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports will launch on August 29,” he said.

“We believe Nestle-Milo is a great brand fit and that it will enjoy the partnership with the Federation even as AFI is poised to take track and field sport to new levels in India. This year, we are taking it to newer heights by not only increasing the platform’s reach to over 400 districts, but we will also be extending financial support to over 100 district associations across the country as a way of recognizing and rewarding their hard work. It is a reflection of the positive direction in which AFI has been moving, both in identifying and nurturing talent that makes India proud on international platforms,” he said.”

Starting 2019, talent identified at NIDJAM will be trained and groomed by expert coaches at special National Camps, in partnership with Khelo India with Olympics 2024 & 2028 as milestones.

“Sport is part of MILO’s DNA. As a brand, MILO encourages participation in sports at an early age. We believe that participation in   sports helps  a child imbibe life values & lessons that helps to set his or her strong foundations for the future .As the world’s number 1 cocoa-malt beverage, we are honoured  to partner with NIDJAM – one of the  largest Indian national  sports talent-selection programmes Its a proud moment for Nestle MILO and we are certain  that the collaboration with AFI will strengthen our nations commitment to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle,” said Mr. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director Nestlé India Ltd.

The association is structured by AFI’s marketing partners Meraki Sport & Entertainment, and commenting on the association, Ajit Ravindran, Managing Director, Meraki said “While on one hand NIDJAM as a platform has been contributing to our nation’s sporting capital for the last 15 years, on the other, Milo’s philosophy is to enable all round development amongst kids, through sport. There couldn’t have been a better value match. We are excited to bring this to fruition and our role will be to drive value to all key stakeholders – AFI, MILO & the platform itself.”

The 2019 edition will be held between the 24th of 26th of November in Andhra Pradesh.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-728-410.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/honble-sports-minister-rijiju-unveils-nestle-milo-nidjam-logo/,Athletics
AFI to extend financial support to 100 districts to boost track and field sport,"August 2, 2019","AFI Media

New Delhi, August 2: In a landmark decision, aimed at galvanising track and field sport at the grass-roots level, the Athletics Federation of India has decided to provide grants to 100 Districts Athletics Associations in recognition of their consistent good work to promote athletics in their area and compete in the National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet (NIDJAM) each year.

AFI President AdilleSumariwalla said this would be a pilot project this year and would be extended to more districts in a couple of years. “We have always encouraged and recognised work at the grass-roots level, and we believe that this would be the first time a National Sports Federation is providing grants to district associations,” he said.

Mr. Sumariwalla said the Federation was confident that the move to provide grants to district associations would come a fillip to track and field sport at the bottom of the pyramid. “We know that we have to broaden the base to be able to find the talent that can be nurtured to passionately pursue Olympian dreams,” he said.

The AFI President said the idea had the support of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports’ Khelo India programme. “We met the Ministry and Sports Authority of Indian officials a few weeks ago to finalise the modalities of this game-changing move,” Mr. Sumariwalla said. AFI has already initiated the process of identifying the 100 districts to be provided financial support this year.

AFI believes that this move will inspire the State Associations to streamline themselves better. At the recent annual general meeting of the Federation, officials State Associations were told in clear terms to shape up or ship out. AFI also encouraged youngsters from the districts to take up and complete the IAAF Coaches Education and Certification Level 1 programme.

All districts will conduct their championships ahead of the 17th NIDJAM for under-16 and under-14 boys and girls which will be held from November 24. The Federation is planning a meeting with the presidents and secretaries of close to 500 districts to share details of the AFI development programme and motivate them to make athletics more popular in their respective districts.

It may be mentioned that some of India’s brightest athletics stars like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra (2012) and sprinter Dutee Chand (2011) as well as discus thrower Navjeet Kaur Dhillon(2010) and 400m runner V Subha (2014) are among those who cut their teeth in the earlier editions of NIDJAM.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nidjam-photo-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-to-extend-financial-support-to-100-districts-to-boost-track-and-field-sport/,Athletics

Gomathi Marimuthu secures India’s first gold medal in Doha AAC,"April 22, 2019","Gomathi Marimuthu secures India’s first gold medal in Doha AAC

AFI Media

Doha, April 22: Gomathi Marimuthu scripted an amazing story and made a dream come true by winning the women’s 800m gold at the Asian Athletics Championships at the Khalifa Stadium here on Monday. It was India’s first gold medal after three silver, including for javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, and five bronze medals.

Gomathi clocked a personal best of 2:02.70 with a gallant run over the final lap after being pushed to sixth place just after the bell. On the back straight, she went past a pair of Sri Lankan runners and moved to third place with 200m left. Running on the outside, the 30-year-old could sense Kazakhstan’s Margarita Mukasheva and the leader Wang Chunyu losing pace. And she willed herself to sustain her charge till the gold was won.

This was third time lucky for Gomathi, who had finished seventh in the Asian Championship in 2013 and fourth in 2015. She had to come through a confirmatory trial in Patiala where she was paced by quartermiler MR Poovamma. She did not need such support on the track this time as she drew from the energy and intensity to deliver a good performance.

Shivpal Singh also came up with a personal best of 86.23m with his second throw to secure the silver medal behind Chinese Taipei’s Chao-Tsun Cheng who fouled his first throw but flung the spear over a championship record distance of 86.72m. After a third throw of 83.46m, he preferred to pass the other throws fearing an adductor injury.

Shivpal Singh, who opened with 80.89m, had another throw over 81.39m and try as he might, could not dislodge the Chinese Taipei champion from the pedestal. He had the consolation of going past compatriot Neeraj Chopra’s meet mark of 85.23m set with his very last throw in Bhubaneshwar in 2017.

The 400m hurdlers Saritaben Gayakwad and MP Jabir each gave India a bronze medal from the women and men’s races. Both had to overcome the challenge of moving up from the lower positions to the podim. Saritaben Gayakwad clocked 57.22, a shade below her season’s best, while Jabir produced a personal best time of 49.13 seconds.

On Sunday night, the men’s 3000m steeplechase saw Avinash Sable produce a dramatic finish by passing two runners at the final water jump and the final hurdle to secure a creditable silver medal on international debut. His time of 8:30.19 was not far off the National record of 8:28.94 that he set in Patiala last month.

MR Poovamma had to settle for a bronze in the women’s 400m after a photo-finish was used to separate her from the silver medallist Elina Mikhina (Kazakhstan). The race was won with comfort by Salwa Naser of Bahrain. Poovamma clocked 53.21 seconds and her bronze medal was some consolation for India after Hima Das pulled up injured in the semifinal heats.

Gavit Murli Kumar completed India’s five-medal hunt on the opening night when he won bronze in the men’s 10000m to add to the silver that Annu Rani claimed in the women’s javelin throw and the bronze that Parul Chaudhary got by beating compatriot Sanjivani Jadhav on the final straight.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gomathi-marimuthu-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/gomathi-marimuthu-secures-indias-first-gold-medal-in-doha-aac/,Athletics
"Toor, Johnson, Swapna Barman expected to replicate Asian Games success in AAC2019","April 20, 2019","AFI Media

Doha, April 20: Asian Games gold medallists shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, middle-distance runner Jinson Johnson, heptathlete Swapna Barman and the women’s 4x400m squad will headline the Indian challenge in the four-day Asian Athletics Championships, beginning at the Khalifa Stadium here on Sunday.

The 24-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor has been consistently going past the 19m mark for five years now and his 20.13m in the Grand Prix in Patiala in February has placed the Asian Games gold medallist as the early leader in the continent. Jinson Johnson’s powerful kick has earned him a reputation and will take to the track with confidence.

Swapna Barman has ruled the roost in the heptathlon, winning gold in the 2017 Asian Atheltics Championships and the Asian Games in Jakarta last year. She will look to complete a hat-trick of Asian crowns. The women’s 4x400m relay team, with its focus on the IAAF World Relays next month, will want to make improvements to its time.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra’s elbow injury and 400m hurdler Ayyasamy Dharun’s stress fracture have kept them away from the competition. Long jumper S Sreeshankar, whose heel injury prevented him from competing in the Federation Cup in Patiala last month, and triple jumper Arpinder Singh are the other big guns who will miss the Asian Athletics Championships.

However, there is an opportunity for others to shine in a quality competition. Their performances will be keenly watched to see how athletes like Gavit Murali Kumar and Avinash Sable come of age. Gavit Murali Kumar and Abhishek Pal in the 5000m and Avinash Sable and Shankar Lal Swami in the steeplechase are capable athletes as is 23-year-old Mohammed Afsal, who has been picked to replace Manjit Singh in the middle-distance events.

India has roped in Davinder Singh Kang in Neeraj Chopra’s place in the squad. It is hopeful that he will rediscover the big-meet temperament that made him India’s first finalist in the men’s javelin throw in the 2017 IAAF World Athletics Championship in London. With Shivpal Singh already throwing beyond 80m this season, they can expect a medal between them.

On Sunday, Annu Rani has the opportunity to show that she has overcome memories of a sixth-place finish in javelin event the Asian Games in Jakarta. She recorded a throw of 62.34m in the Federation Cup in Patiala last month and will expect to give the Chinese a run for their money when she steps up the runway on Sunday.

The women’s 400m final will hold a lot of interest. The team’s coaching staff and the runners are well aware that the season top list – where Hima Das and M R Poovamma lead a bunch nine Indians in the top 10 in Asia – is no real indication of what to expect in the competition here. They will seek medals and then get down to working towards improving the time in the 4x400m relay.

Avinash Sable, who broke Gopal Saini’s old men’s 3000m steeplechase National record and then lowered it in the Federation Cup, could be up against seasoned competitors but has the potential to run a tactical race and make his maiden Asian competition memorable while Parul Chaudhary will have to come up with her best against Chinese and Japanese runners in the women’s 5000m.

Gavit Murali Kumar, who finished sixth in the men’s 5000m in the Asian Championships in Bhubaneshwar in July 2017, and Abhishek Pal, who was Asian junior silver medallist in 2016, will have to run a smart race. Arokia Rajiv, who has emerged India’s fastest in the men’s 400m this year, and Muhammad Anas will also be in action in the opening round on Sunday.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/13-2.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/toor-johnson-swapna-barman-expected-to-replicate-asian-games-success-in-aac2019/,Athletics

Federation Cup Athletics begins on Friday in Patiala,"March 14, 2019","AFI Media
14/03/2019

Patiala. Arpinder Singh, Asian Games gold medallist and the first Indian to win a medal at the IAAF Inter-continental Cup, will be the leading contender in the Men’s Triple Jump heats at the 23rd Federation Cup Senior National Athletics Championships to be held at the National Institute of Sport, Patiala from March 15-18, 2019.

Neena Pinto will start the favorite in the women’s Long Jump section. The Asian Games silver medallist will be joined by last year’s Fed Cup gold medallist Nayana James.

In the absence of Asian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Neeraj Chopra, the Javelin throw men’s category is set for an interesting four-way battle. Sahil Silwal, Vipin Kassana, Shivpal Singh and the returning Davinder Singh Kang should make it an event worth following. In the women’s section, national record holder Annu Rani will be the overwhelming pick for the gold medal.

Reigning Asian champion Swapna Barman will be in action in the Heptathlon. The 22-year-old from Jalpaiguri is expected to break the 6000-point barrier once again but Odisha’s Purnima Hembram is expected to push Barman all the way.

The men’s High Jump field will be a depleted one in the absence of last year’s gold and silver medallists. NCAA champion and NR holder Tejaswin Shankar is absent, as is the 2018 Fed Cup silver medallist Siddharth Yadav. Balasubramanya Chethan, who represented India at the Asian Games in Jakarta, will be the athlete to watch out for in this section.

In the Hammer Throw competition, junior National Record holder Ashish Jakhar is expected to bring home the gold medal.

S Siva, the national record holder in Pole Vault, will be back to defend his crown in Patiala. The 22-year-old set his previous record of 5.15 metres last year in Patiala.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/16-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/federation-cup-athletics-begins-on-friday-in-patiala/,Athletics
"Jasmine, Shaili sets new national record at National Junior Championships","November 2, 2018","02 Nov. 18
AFI Media

Ranchi. Jasmine Kaur of Punjab & Karnataka’s Shaili Singh got the 34th National Junior Athletics Championships off to a grand start with new National Records on the first day of the four-day competition at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium in Ranchi on Friday.

Jasmine set a record in the U-16 girls shot put event. Representing Punjab she flung the iron ball to a distance of 14.27m to eclipse the previous national record of 14.21m recorded by Paramjot Kaur two years ago at the Junior National Championships in Coimbatore.

Jasmine started out with a throw of 12.93m before setting the new national record with her second throw of the competition. She followed that effort with two more throws above 14m in her fourth (14.07m) and fifth attempts (14.03m).

Kaur was followed on the podium by Anjali of Haryana who also went past the old national mark with a best effort of 14.22m. Anjali opened with a throw of 13.39m and subsequently a foul mark before flinging the iron ball past the 14m mark on her fourth attempt of the competition. Anjali wouldn’t improve on that mark and had to be satisfied with the silver medal.

The bronze medal went to Tamil Nadu’s M Sharmila who secured the medal with her very last throw of the competition. Sharmila was trailing Haryana’s Shiksha (13.28m) until the final series of the competition. In her final attempt though she managed an effort of 13.82m to secure the third step of the podium.

Shaili leaped to a distance of 5.94m in her last attempt to register a new National Record and grab a gold medal in the U-16 girls long jump event.

Kavya M of Tamil Nadu won a silver medal with an effort of 5.38m while Haryana’s Jyoti settled for a bronze with a distance of 5.30m.

Amongst the other athletes to put up strong performances was Punjab long jumper Renu who eclipsed the old meet record in the women’s U-20 long jump competition. Renu recorded a best effort of 6.22m to erase the previous meet record of 6.19m set by Asian Games silver medalist V Neena at the 2010 edition of the Junior National Championships in Bangalore. The national record of 6.30m stands in the name of Priyanka Karket set in 2017.

Renu began her competition with a jump of 5.98m and followed that up with an effort of 6.05m –the first of her three jumps over six meters. She next record two foul throws before setting a new meet record of 6.22m. She looked to improve on that mark with her final jump of the competition but was only able to sign off with a jump of 6.08m.

Following Renu on the podium were Harshini Saravanan of Tamil Nadu who recorded a jump of 6.09m with her final jump of the competition. She next best jump of the day was 5.99m which would have left her tied for second place with her statemate A Sherin who eventually finished with a bronze medal.

Javelin thrower Yashvir Singh, who had won a silver medal at the 2018 Khelo India School Games, too made a strong impression as he won the men’s U-18 javelin throw competition winning gold with a powerful throw of 75.63m. The effort was less than a meter short of the existing meet record of 76.50m recorded by Asian Games and Commonwealth Games champion Neeraj Chopra, at the 2014 edition of the tournament in Vijaywada.

Singh beat out reigning national Youth Champion Rohit Yadav who finished second with a credible 75.14m. Nandkishor Singh of Delhi claimed the third step on the podium with a best throw of 72.30m.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/7-5.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/jasmine-shaili-sets-new-national-record-at-national-junior-championships/,Athletics
Indian Athletics team finish Asian Games 2018 with 7 gold medals,"August 30, 2018","AFI Media
30 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). India finished the 2018 Asian Games with a total of 7 gold, 10 silver and 2 bronze medals in Athletics. This was India’s second highest medal tally in Athletics ever at the Asiad, as the contingent finished the final day of athletics action with two gold medals.

The women’s 4X400 metre relay team kept a streak of four Asian Games gold medals alive, stretching it to five in Jakarta.

Hima Das ran the lead leg of the race for team India, giving team India a solid start, and she was followed by Saritaben Gaikwad and MR Poovamma, who extended the gap between India and the rest of the teams. As women’s individual 400 metres gold medallist Salwa Eid Naser chased VK Vismaya, the latter ran a composed race to finish well ahead of the Bahrain team to clinch gold. This was Hima Das’ third medal of these Asian Games, to go with her silver in the 400 metres individual race and the mixed 4X400 relay.

National record holder Jinson Johnson won silver in the 800 metres, but he was not to be denied in the 1500, as Jinson won the gold, making it two medals for the Kerala runner at the 2018 Asian Games.

Johnson ran a superb, tactical race, holding back till the final 300 metres to start pushing the pace of the race as a late kick won him his first Asiad gold. The 27-year-old had broken Bahadur Prasad’s national record in the event at the Inter-State Championships.

Manjit Singh, the 800 metres gold medallist, ran a similar race to his winning run earlier, but left his charge too late to finish fourth, denying him a chance to win two medals.

The men’s 4X400 relay team brought home India’s 19th and final athletics medal, a silver. Kunhu Muhammed ran the lead leg, followed by Ayyasamy Dharun. By the time India’s fastest quarter-miler Muhammed Anas took over in the 3rd leg, Qatar’s lead was too much and despite his and Arokia Rajiv’s best efforts, the male quarter could not make up the deficit.

Seema Punia finished with a bronze in the women’s Discus Throw, managing a seasonal best of 62.26 metres, finishing behind two Chinese throwers. Punia added a bronze to her gold medal at Incheon four years ago. Sandeep Kumari finished fifth, managing a best attempt of 54.61 metres.

PU Chitra bagged India’s second bronze of the day in the women’s 1500 metres final. The 2017 Asian Athletics Championships winner Chitra won the race in a time of 4:12.56.

Govindan Lakshmanan finished 6th in the 5,000 metres final, as he came home in a time of 14:17.09. Bahrain’s Birhanu Balew won the race with a time of 13:43.17.

Sandeep Kumar was disqualified in the men’s 50 km race for three faults.

Gujarat all set to host National Youth athletics meet after two decades,"July 19, 2018","AFI Media
19 July 2018

Vadodara:India’s emerging track and field athletes in the Under-18 (Youth) category will be in action during the 15th National Youth Athletics Championships which will kick-off at the Manjalpur Sports Complex here on Saturday. A total of 634 athletes including 364 boys and 270 girls from 24 states the country has registered for the prestigious U18 athletics event organised by Athletics Federation of India (AFI) annually.

The three-day competition will feature 20 events each in boys and girls U18 categories. Athletes born between 1st January 2001 to 31st December 2002 are eligible to compete in the competition.

Congratulating Gujarat Athletics Association (GAA) for hosting the meet in Vadodara, Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President, said, “It is after a long gap of 21 years Gujarat is hosting a national level meet. On behalf of AFI I would like to thank Gujarat state athletics association for coming forward and hosting this meet,”

“In the youth category, India is making rapid progress in athletics on the world level. Hima Das, our 18-year old athlete from Assam, who recently became the new U20 world champion in 400m and javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, who became India’s first world champion in athletics two years ago when he won the gold medal in U20 world championships, have set examples for our young athletes. I hope, we will see many more such athletes coming up from our youth competitions and I wish Vadodara, a very successful meet,” said Sumariwalla.

Hima Das is the new 400m World Junior Champion,"July 13, 2018","Hima Das created history at the U-20 World Athletics Championships in Tampere, Finland on Thursday, winning the women’s 400m to become the first Indian track athlete to win a gold medal at a global athletic event.  Das clocked 51.46 seconds to beat Romania’s Andrea Miklos who finished a distant second in 52.07 seconds while Taylor Manson of USA trailed further back to take bronze in 52.28 seconds. Das is only the second Indian athlete to have won a gold at the U-20 World Championships following javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra who won his title in the 2016 edition.

The 18-year-old from Assam was considered the odds on favourite to win the event having entered the competition as the fastest in the field. She didn’t show any sign of vulnerability in the competition, winning both her heat (with a time of 52.25 seconds) and the semifinal (with a time of 52.10 seconds).  She would only improve on that time in the final. Running in lane four in the final, Das appeared to have got off to a slow start and seemed to be under pressure at the first bend. She also appeared to be trailing behind the leaders at the 300m mark but kept a cool head and managed to reel them in steadily in the final stretch. She eventually win with a sizeable lead over her rivals.

Das’ victory is only the latest high point in a career that exploded ever since she first began her athletics career in 2016. Born in Dhing village of Assam, Das was originally a football player before she shifted her focus to athletics. Although a late starter, Das, first made a mark at the 2017 Youth Nationals and was subsequently picked for the Asian Youth Championships where she finished seventh and then took part at the World Youth Championships the same year where she finished 5th in the 200m.

Das shifted to the 400m soon after and continued to find success. She won the Asian Games Test event in February this year and subsequently qualified for the Commonwealth Games with a victory at the Federation Cup in March. Das was one of the stand out performers at the Gold Coast Games and nearly pulled off a huge upset before eventually settling for sixth in a high class field in the final of the 400m.

Das has since steadily improved, winning a gold medal at the Inter State Championships in June with a personal best time of 51.13 seconds. Although Das was not able to match that effort at the Ratina Stadium in Tampere, there will be little doubt that the gold medal will be a prize she will be more than satisfied with.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hima-Das-is-the-new-400m-World-Junior-Champion.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/hima-das-is-the-new-400m-world-junior-champion/,Athletics
Hima Das leads 31 strong contingent to Junior World Championships,"July 5, 2018","New Delhi. Tipped to bring back an elusive track medal for the country at the World Junior Championships, quarter miler Hima Das will be leading a squad of 31 Indian athletes – 21 men and 10 women — to the IAAF U20 World Junior Championships to be held in the Finnish city of Tampere between 10th and 15th of July 2018.

The 18-year-old Das, has been going from strength to strength ever since she first broke into the national scene with a pair of medals at the Indian U-18 Youth Nationals in February 2018. Although Das had won just a silver and bronze in that tournament, she has made a name for herself as the fastest active athlete over the 200 and 400m in India. The athlete from Dhing village in Assam has even made a mark in international competition with an impressive sixth place finish in the 400m event at the Commonwealth Games in April this year. Das is in red hot form heading into the competition in Finland, having won the 400m title at the Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati last month.

Her winning time of 51.13 seconds makes her one of the form favourites for the Junior Worlds with only one other athlete – USA’s Sydney McLaughlin – having recorded a faster time this year.

Das is not the only athlete who will be expecting to compete for medals at the World Championships. Among the men, junior national record holder M Sreeshankar would be carrying the most responsibility. The long jumper’s personal best of 7.99m set at the Federation Cup in March this year is the fourth best jump by a Junior athlete this year. However, Sreeshankar suffered a setback when he suffered a severe case of appendicitis shortly after his record-breaking jump in Patiala. The Kerala athlete however has managed to regain some of his lost form winning a bronze medal at the Asian Junior Championships in Gifu last month with an effort of 7.47m. Sreeshankar will have company in Tampere as compatriot Satyanathan Lokesh has also been named to the squad. Lokesh goes into the competition in 11th place amongst junior athletes this season with a season’s best of 7.74m recorded at the South Asian Junior Championships in May.

Also looking to carry on some form from the Asian Junior championships would be the hammer throw pair of Ashish Jhakar and Damneet Singh who took first and second place at the tournament in Gifu last month. Jhakhar’s throw of 76.86m places him sixth amongst junior athletes this season while Singh’s season’s best of 74.08 places him eleventh. Despite a slightly shorter throw, Singh would be carrying a bit of confidence of competing and winning at the international level, having clinched a silver medal at the World Youth Championships in Nairobi last year.

Competing under a bit of pressure would be javelin thrower Sahil Silwal. The 18-year-old has big shoes to fill. He will be looking to emulate senior compatriot Neeraj Chopra, who at the 2016 edition of the tournament in Bydgoszcz, set a new junior world record with a throw of 86.48m to became the first Indian to win a gold medal at an IAAF world event.

Silwal’s best is 74.88m that he recorded last month in Kuortane Motonet GP in Finland. The mark places him fifth amongst junior javelin throwers. However, Silwal’s coach Uwe Hohn has tipped the youngster to cross the 80m mark soon and Tampere would be as good a tournament as any to create a new personal best.

Heading into the competition full of confidence would be middle distance runner Beant Singh. Marked out for success at an early age following a silver medal in the 800m at the Open Nationals in 2014 and then a gold medal at the Asian Youth Championships the following year, Beant suffered a series of injuries that caused his career to falter. An exit in the heats at the 2016 Junior World championships in a sub-par time of 1:51.73 seconds was a particular low point. The Haryana athlete though has found some momentum once again clocking 1:46.92 seconds in a fourth-place finish at last month’s Inter State Championships. That timing is the seventh fastest in amongst junior athletes this year.

The selection committee of AFI which met on Saturday 30th June 2018 after the conclusion of 58th National Inter State Senior Athletics Championships which also served as the final selection trials for the Asiad, unanimously approved holding of confirmatory trials for those athletes who were not part of the national coaching camps as well as those who failed to meet the Asian Games selection guidelines in Guwahati set by AFI in advance.

“The team that will travel to Jakarta will be finalised after confirmatory trials on 15-16 August 2018. Only those athletes who were not in coaching camps will have to give confirmatory trials. However, as announced earlier, the 4x400m relay team will consist of only those athletes who were in the national coaching camps. The athletes who were exempted in advance from attending the final selection trials such as Neeraj Chopra and Seema Poonia will not be attending the confirmatory trials,” said Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President.

25 June 2018

Guwahati. With spots in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games up for grabs, the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships, beginning June 26th in Guwahati, is expected to be a keenly contested affair.

While a few high profile names including Commonwealth gold medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and Commonwealth silver medalist discus thrower Seema Antil have been granted exemption from participation, the track section of the four day long competition should likely throw up some big results.  This will be largely due to the strict qualification guidelines — equivalent to top-4 or top-5 performance of the last Asian Games in almost all the events – and the fact that several athletes have been delivering strong performances in recent weeks.

Multiple Asian gold medalist PT Usha said the women’s 400m would in particular be an event to watch out for. “The competition in certain track events will be really strong here in Guwahati as athletes are well prepared. Since it is the final selection trial, athletes are determined to give their best. Hima Das has produced some really good results this year and I hope she will continue this for the rest of the season,” Usha said.

The 18-year-old Das is expected to be the highlight of what will be her home event. Das has improved dramatically in recent months. The Assam sprinter clocked a personal best of 23.22 seconds in the 200m in Poland earlier this month while she ran 51.32 seconds in 400m during the Gold Coast CWG. “”I have just returned from Poland where we went for month long training and I am feeling good. I am fully prepared for Inter State,” Das said.

Yet Das will face tough competition in both events. In 200m, she will compete against the likes of Dutee Chand and Srabani Nanda  while Asian championship gold medalist Nirmala Sheoran, who has a personal best of 51.28 seconds,  is expected to pose a serious threat. With veterans M R Poovamma and Jauna Murmu coming into form and teenager Jisna Mathew fresh off a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships, there are sure to be fireworks on the track.

Amongst the athletes to watch out for in the men’s section will be quartermiler Muhammad Anas. The 23-year-old who broke the national record during the Gold Coast CWG with an effort of 45.31 seconds, will also be competing in the 200m.

The results of the two 400m races will be particularly fascinating owing to the fact that the selectors would also be picking the team for the 4x400m mixed relay, to be held for the first time at the Asian Games this time. India has a decent chance to win a gold in this event.

In the long-distance section, plenty of eyes would be on 21-year-old Gavit Murli Kumar, who became the second fastest Indian in 10,000m with a 28:43.34 sec effort at the Gouden Spike Meet earlier this month, would want to show that his impressive display was no fluke. Murli, who is also competing in the 5000m race, though will not have it easy with double Asian gold medalist G Lakshmanan and T Gopi also in the fray.

An additional item of interest to the competition would be the return to the track of steeplechaser Lalita Babar. The 29-year-old former Asian Games bronze medalist had been out of action for over a year following her marriage but will be hoping to make up for lost time at the Indira Gandhi athletics stadium.

“We are expecting a very high level of competition this year in Inter State championships. The weather in Guwahati is perfect for athletes. I want to thank Honorable CM of Assam Shri Sarbananda Sonwal for providing such good facilities to all the teams and our National Campers here in Guwahati,” said CK Valson.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/All-eyes-on-Hima-Anas-ahead-of-Inter-State-athletics.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/all-eyes-on-hima-anas-ahead-of-inter-state-athletics/,Athletics
AFI to athletes: Trials must for selection,"June 21, 2018","NEW DELHI: India’s leading track and field athletes like discus throwers Vikas Gowda and Seema Punia or high jumper Tejaswin Shankar and hurdler Siddhanth Thingalaya, who are training privately in India and abroad away from the national camp, will have to mandatorily appear for the Asian Games selection trial at the Interstate meet in Guwahati later next month. A no-show at the June 26-29 meet will mean losing their spots in the Asiad-bound contingent.

This decision was taken by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) with a view to select the best athletes for the Jakarta-Palembang Asiad, considering both the tough competition and also the fact that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) wouldn’t be sending a huge contingent to Indonesia.

However, the federation has decided to exempt star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra from the Guwahati meet since he’s consistently throwing the javelin past the Asiad qualification mark of 82m.

Neeraj is one of India’s best medal bets at the Asiad given his gold medal effort in Gold Coast and the recent fourth-place finish in the Doha Diamond League. However, this decision has led to some heartburn among the other elite Indian athletes.

For someone like Incheon Games silver medallist Gowda, who has repeatedly requested the AFI to allow him to compete at a qualifier closer to his training base in Phoenix, US and not to make him fly all the way to India for trials, the federation has made no exception. This time too, the same issue has cropped up and according to an AFI official, there’s no word yet from Gowda about his appearance in Guwahati. Others training abroad are likely to attend the trials.

“Well, the rules should have been the same for everyone. If an appearance in qualifier is compulsory, then it must remain that way for all athletes. But, why should I alone be seen as someone complaining?” an athlete reacted.

The AFI’s logic is simple: “Neeraj is constantly touching the 86-87m mark. He’s also part of the national camp in Finland.

“The federation and coaches know about his effort. But in the cases of those training abroad, we don’t know about their performances and timing. We don’t know about their injury status. How could we select them for Asiad without assessing their performance and fitness?”

During the selection for the Gold Coast CWG, the AFI had made it compulsory for all athletes – including those training abroad – to appear for the qualifier, the Federation Cup, in Patiala in March.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AFI-to-athletes-Trials-must-for-selection.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-to-athletes-trials-must-for-selection/,Athletics
Will it be a SUPER SATURDAY for India at CWG,"April 13, 2018","AFI Media
13 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra led the charge of the Indian athletics contingent at the Carrara Stadium on Friday. Faced with the task of clearing a mark of 78m to automatically qualify for the final of the javelin throw event, the 20-year-old needed just one attempt to fling the spear a distance of 80.42m. Chopra might have been able to exceed that mark but chose not to take the next two attempts in an effort to conserve energy for the finals. Chopra has a season’s best of 85.93m recorded at the Federation Cup last month, while his personal best of 86.48m recorded at the IAAF U20 World Championships is the current national record. At the finals on Saturday, Chopra would be itching to increase that record by some margin.

Chopra wasn’t the only Indian to make it to the finals though. Teammate Vipin Kasana also made just one attempt at the javelin throw, clearing a distance of 78.88m. The result was a marked improvement compared to his effort at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. At that event, Kasana, 30, was only able to record a best of 71.95m in qualifying round and did not proceed to the finals.

Neeraj’s throw wasn’t the best of the day. Four other throwers managed better performances than him.  Hamish Peacock of Australia topped qualifying with a throw of 81.22m while Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan and Anderson Peters of Grenada were second and third with a throw of 80.45m and 80.44m respectively. Unlike Chopra and Kasana, those athletes didn’t have it easy. None of them managed to clear the mark of 78m in their first or second throws. Peacock had efforts of 74.58m and 76.49m. Pakistan’s Nadeem had a foul throw before recording a legal throw above the 80m mark. Peters of Grenada too kept his best for last with throws of 76.93m and 76.08m before clearing the qualifying standard.

One shock absentee from the final is Kenya’s Julius Yego. The Olympic silver medalist and former world champion had a personal best of 92.72m and throw of 87.97m last season. The Kenyan had been out of form in the run up to the Games. Yego, only managed throws of 74.55m and 73.67m but failed to cross the qualifying standard.

India also qualified for the final of the men’s 4x400m relay. The team anchored by Arokia Rajiv comprised Amoj Jacob, Mohammand Anas and K Suresh finished second in their heats with a time of 3.04.05 seconds, just short of top ranked Jamaica who crossed the finish line in 3.03.97 seconds. Bahamas finished third with 3.04.62 seconds. The other heat was won by favorites Botswana who in fact clocked a slower time than India (3.05.01 seconds) while Kenya and Fiji finished second and third with a time of 3.13.52seconds and 3.19.19 seconds. With India having qualified second for the final, with the second fastest time, the team, helmed by national record holder Mohammad Anas, would be expected to finish on the podium.

The Indian 4x400m women’s team comprising MR Poovamma, Saritaben Gayakwad, Soniya Baishya and Hima Das will also look for a podium finish in the finals tomorrow. With just eight teams entering the competition, there were no qualifying heats for this event today.

India capped the day with a bit of good news. Purnima Hembram finished seventh in the women’s heptathlon but managed to finish with a new personal best. Hembram added 837 points in the long jump with a leap of 5.96m, 697 points with a best effort of 41.57m in the javelin throw and 859 points in the women’s 800m with a time of 2.17.44 seconds. Hembram finished with a total of 5834 points to finish in 7th place in a tough group.

Meanwhile in men’s triple jump final on Saturday, India’s hopes rests with Arpinder Singh who qualified for the finals earlier on Wednesday.",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Will-it-be-a-SUPER-SATURDAY-for-India-at-CWG.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/will-it-be-a-super-saturday-for-india-at-cwg/,Athletics

Gold Coast (Australia). All eyes will be on Neeraj Chopra ahead of the athletics competitions of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. No Indian athlete has ever won a gold in the javelin throw at the Games, but the 20-year-old from the village of Khandra in Haryana’s Panipat district might well break that trend. Chopra, who has a personal best of 86.48m, is coming into the Games with a season’s best of 85.94m. That throw is the best amongst Commonwealth Games this season. Also in Chopra’s favour is the fact that former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott is skipping the games while 2016 Olympic silver medalist Julius Yego of Kenya has been woefully out of form.

Should Chopra win gold, it would be only the fifth ever for India at the games. Only Milkha Singh (440 yards, 1958), women’s 4x400m (2010), Krishna Poonia (women’s discus, 2010) and Vikas Gowda (men’s discus, 2014) have won gold previously.

Chopra is one of several medal winning prospects for the Indian team. Competing in what she says will be her final Commonwealth Games, Seema Punia will be looking to end her journey on a high. The 34-year-old who has won two silver and a bronze medal so far will look to go all out this time around.

Triple jumper Arpinder Singh, who won a bronze medal at the 2014 Games, is also bidding to improve the colour of his prize this time around. “I think gold will go for 17m and I feel I can do it,” said Arpinder, the second best jumper among Commonwealth athletes this season with his 16.61 at the Federation Cup.

Also amongst India’s brightest prospects will be 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. The student of Kansas State University, broke his own national record of 2.26m this year with a jump of 2.28m at the Federation Cup this year. That leap was the best amongst Commonwealth Games athletes this year and he is expecting to improve on that performance at the gold coast games. Tejaswin is one of a new generation of athletes who are making massive strides. 18-year-old Hima Das, who will be competing in the individual 400m as well as the relay and 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be competing in the men’s 400m relay

India could even win their first medal on the opening day of the competition itself in the women’s 20km race walk. Race walker B Soumya set a new national record in the women’s 20km walk. Her time of 1.31.28 seconds is the third best by a Commonwealth athlete this season. India’s athletics campaign at the Games will begin with Men’s 20km walk featuring national record holder Irfan KT and Manish Rawat.

With several Indians up amongst the medal winning bracket, coaches are optimistic about the competition. “We are expecting five to six medals this time but don’t ask me what colour they will be,” deputy chief National coach Radhakrishnan Nair said. “And yes, in terms of number of medals, this promises to be our best ever outside India.”",Neeraj Chopra,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/16-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indias-athletics-campaign-begins-tomorrow-at-cwg-2018/,Athletics
2018 Commonwealth Games: Know your CWG athlete – Arpinder Singh,"March 26, 2018","NEW DELHI: Arpinder Singh, the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games bronze-medallist in triple jump, qualified for the 2018 CWG to be held at Gold Coast Australia from April 4-15 with a jump of 16.61m at the Federation Cup athletics meet earlier this month.

The 22-year-old from Amritsar held the national record in triple jump in 2014 before it was broken by Renjith Maheshwary.

Arpinder, who started out as a 100m sprinter, switched to triple jump at the school level and soon found success. He won a silver medal at the Under-17 School Games with a jump of 13.86 and in 2009 claimed gold at the Youth National Games.

In 2013, Arpinder broke the 16m mark and smashed Maheshwary’s national record and in 2014 won bronze at the Commonwealth Games. After two failed attempts, he jumped 16.51m to qualify for the finals, where he bettered his qualification mark with a jump of 16.63m, but had to settle for bronze behind Khotso Mokoena (17.20m) and Tosin Oke (16.84m).

2015 Arpinder got the Government’s nod to train at the London Coaching Foundation but failed to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the 57th National Open Athletics Championships in 2017, he had to settle for silver with a jump of 16.06m with Kerala’s Sreejithmon claiming gold (16.15m)

Indian men’s athletics team for 2018 CWG: Jinson Johnson (men’s 1500m), Dharun Ayyasamy (400m, 4x400m relay), Tejaswin Shankar (high jump), Siddharth Yadav (high jump), Sreeshankar (long jump), Arpinder Singh (triple jump), Rakesh Babu (triple jump), Tajinderpal Singh Toor (shot put), Neeraj Chopra (javelin throw), Vipin Kasana (javelin throw), Irfan Kolothum Thodi (20km race walk), Manish Singh Rawat (20km race walk), Muhammed Anas Yahiya (4x400m relay), Jeevan Karekoppa Suresh (4x400m relay), Amoj Jacob (4x400m relay), Kunhu Mohammed (4x400m relay), Jithu Baby (4x400m relay), Arokiya Rajiv (4x400m relay)

RUN ADAM IGP PREVIEW,"February 26, 2018","Athletics season starts with Run Adam IGP in Patiala on Tuesday

AFI Media
26 February 2018

Patiala: Javelin throw national record holder Neeraj Chopra will be the star performer in action at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1 (Run Adam IGP) to be held in the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday. Chopra though will only be one of a total of 129 competitors for whom the prestigious one day event essentially marks the beginning of the Indian domestic calendar.

For the athletes, the eventual goal is to match the qualifying standards for the Commonwealth Games. While the Run Adam IGP will likely serve as a warm up event ahead of the Federation Cup in early March, the high quality of the field could well spring up a few surprises.

For Chopra the tournament will be a first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

While this is the first domestic tournament, several of the athletes are in strong form, having competed in prior international events. 100m sprinter Elakiya Dasan is fresh off a bronze medal at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January and subsequently another bronze at the Asian Games Test event in Jakarta. In the latter event he had clocked 10.31 seconds which is the fastest time run by an Indian outside India. He will be challenged by Amiya Mallick who holds the national record in the 100m of 10.26 seconds. Mallick, who has been training in the USA for the past one month has set his target as qualifying for the Commonwealth Games.

Other athletes to watch out for are long jumper Nayana James, who claimed a silver medal at the Asian Indoor Championships and a bronze at the Asian Championship, shot putter Tejinder Pal Toor who won a silver at Bhubaneshwar and national record holder and defending Asian quarter mile champion Mohammad Anas.

Amongst the youngsters to keep an eye on is 18-year-old Hima Das who clocked an impressive personal best of 23.59 seconds in the women’s 200m at the Asian Games. The time was the second fastest by a U-20 athlete this year. While Das will only be running in the 100m in Patiala, she would be keen to make a mark at that event too.

Due to fewer entries in women’s shot put and discus throw and men’s high jump, these events have been dropped from the competition.

"Davinder makes history, enters World Championships final","August 11, 2017","New Delhi, Aug 11: Davinder Sing Kang throws himself into history as he qualifies for the finals of Javelin Throw at the IAAF World Championships in London 2017 on Thursday. In his third and last attempt there came the throw of 84.22m, thus becoming the only Indian athlete to qualify for the finals of an event at the competition so far and first ever to do so in javelin throw discipline from India.

The 28-year-old, who has a personal best of 84.57m, was consistent throughout his three attempts and began his challenge with an 82.22m throw. He followed it up with an 82.14m attempt before going for the huge 84.22m that resulted in his qualification and took an overall 7th position. The automatic qualification mark for the championships was 83m.

It was in May this year that Kang hit headlines as he broke his personal best and threw the javelin a whopping 84.57m in the Indian Grand Prix in Patiala, clinching gold as well as a spot in the World Championships.

Earlier in the Group A qualification, Asian champion Neeraj Chopra, who was the biggest hope of India at the World Championships missed out by a small fraction as he came as close as 82.26m in his first attempt. Much to the disappointment of everyone he fouled in his second attempt and an average throw of 80.54m does put him on the waiting list for the results of Group B. The junior world record holder with a personal best of 86.48m and a season best of 85.63m at the recently concluded Asian Athletics Championships was out thrown by the Group B athletes, as many as eight throwers crossed the automatic qualification mark of 83m and five from Group A bringing the 19 year old’s London campaign to an end in the 15th position.

But it was 2017 World Leader Johannes Vetter of Germany was the star of the event as he launched the Javelin a massive 91.20m on his first attempt and the only one to smash the 90m mark.

The championships which will provide an opportunity to Indian athletes to qualify for the upcoming Asian Athletics Championships to be held in Bhubaneswar from 6-9 July 2017 will begin with the Women and Men 5000m finals.

More than 700 athletes from around the country have registered for the prestigious athletics event organised by Athletics Federation of India (AFI) every year.

AFI is glad to receive such a large number of entries even though we had to change the venue from Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi to Patiala at the last moment.

“AFI is thankful to Punjab Athletics Association and Sports Authority of India for their support and making the last-minute arrangements for the competition,” said AFI President.

Thiruvananthapuram, March 27: Tamil Nadu’s Archana Suseendran beat Hima Das in the 100m final and made the most of the Assam sprinter’s disqualification in the 200m to claim a double and steal the thunder in the women’s events in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 2 at the Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education here today.

Archana Suseendran won the 100m in 11.52 seconds, 0.22 seconds ahead of Hima Das, and the 200m in 23.21 seconds.

Vismaya beats Hima Das over 400m at Indian GP,"March 2, 2019","AFI Media
02 March 2019

Sangrur (Punjab). VK Vismaya created an upset of sorts as she beat fancier names to win the gold medal in the women’s 400m race at the Indian Grand Prix-3 held in Sangrur on Saturday. Vismaya, who had won a gold medal as part of the Indian 4x400m team that won gold at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, has only been competing in international tournaments since 2018, but she managed to get the better of both two time Asian Games gold medalist MR Poovamma and World Junior champion and national record holder Hima Das.

Timings and efforts were on the lower side as athletes competed in chilly conditions at the War Heroes Stadium in Sangrur, Punjab. However, that did little to deter the 22-year-old Vismaya, who recorded a time of 53.80. She was 0.26 seconds faster than MR Poovamma who clocked a time of 54.06. The bronze medal was claimed by Prachi of Uttar Pradesh who recorded a time of 54.49. Prachi though managed to keep Hima Das off the podium. Das, who holds the Indian national record of 50.79 in her name, was well off her best as she recorded a time of 55.19. The time was the slowest of her career. However, Das was only running her first competitive race of the season and is likely to improve as the season progresses. The victory was the second for Vismaya at the Indian GP this season. She had also won a gold medal at the first Indian GP of the season in Patiala on February 23rd.

Meanwhile, Rajiv Arokia won the men’s 400m race with the timing of 46.32. National record holder Mohammed Anas who made a start to his season with Sangrur meet clocked 46.60 and finished second while with the timing of 46.75 Jeevan KS won the bronze medal.

Another national record holder, M Shreeshankar was also well off his personal best in the long jump, but still managed to do enough to win the gold medal in Sangrur. Sreeshankar recorded a best jump of 7.74m to step on top of the podium. Sreeshankar, who had a personal best of 8.20m, recorded a jump of 7.72m to start out with before improving to 7.74 with his second. He recorded a subsequent jump of 7.70m before fouling his fourth attempt. That effort would be his last of the competition as he opted out of his final two attempts. The silver medal would go to M Silambarasan of Tamil Nadu who recorded a best effort of 7.25m on his third attempts. Silambarasan narrowly beat out Siddharth Mohan Naik of Karnataka who took the third step of the podium with an effort only 1cm short of silver place. Naik recorded a jump of 7.24m as his best of the competition.

An upset was also the outcome of the men’s 800m race. Asian Games gold medalist Manjeet Singh had to be content with a silver medal after clocking a time of 1.49.82. The gold medal would go to Kerala’s Mohammad Afsal who crossed the finish line in a time of 1.49.48. Ankit of Haryana clinched bronze with an time of 1.50.11.

There would also be disappointment for Jisna Mathews who could only record a third-place finish in the women’s 800m. Mathews, a 400m bronze medalist at the Asian Championships, has been running the 800m this season. She had success in her first race, winning the Indian GP in Patiala in February but was off the pace in her second attempt over the distance in Sangrur. The 20-year-old recorded a time of 2.09.60 to finish behind Shalu Chaudhary of Delhi and Archana Adhav of Maharashtra. Chaudhary won the race with a time of 2.08.69 while Adhav came in second with a time of 2.09.43.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/9-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/vismaya-beats-hima-das-over-400m-at-indian-gp/,Athletics
Hima Das joins adidas,"September 18, 2018","AFI Media

New Delhi. Adidas today welcomed young athletics sensation Hima Das into the adidas family. Hima, already a big fan of adidas (she wore adidas sprint spikes in her historic run at the Youth Championships and at the Asian Games) will now be equipped with the very best offerings from adidas for her racing and training needs, as she continues her journey to becoming the best sprinter in the world.

At only 18, the Indian sprinter who is now popularly being referred to as “Golden Girl” and “Dhing Express” has made history by becoming the first Indian athlete to win a gold medal at the world level. Hima, a tenacious and perseverant teenager, became the first ever Indian athlete to win a gold medal at a global track event when she won the women’s 400m at the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Finland, followed by three podiums at the recently concluded Asian Games in Indonesia.

At the announcement of the association, adidas India Managing Director, Mr.  Dave Thomas,  presented Hima with an Adizero Prime SP, one of adidas’ most premium and technical sprinting shoes. The personalised shoe features the sprinter’s name “HIMA DAS” on the right shoe and “CREATE HISTORY” on the left shoe.

“At adidas we believe that ‘through sport, we have the power to change lives’ and Hima is a great example of this. Many of our associations and partnerships are focused on empowering youth in India and making a positive change. We at adidas also believe that as the leading sports brand in India it is important to encourage girls to take up sport and keep playing sport as they get older. Over the last couple of years, Hima and many other Indian women have emerged as torchbearers with their outstanding performances. adidas is very keen to support India’s youth and to build a stronger sporting spirit and ambition in them”, said Mr. Dave Thomas, MD, adidas India

Also present at the announcement was Mr. Sean Van Wyk, Senior Marketing Director, adidas India who said, “Hima is an inspiration not just for women and girls, but for the entire country and we take pride in having her join team adidas. She has created history and we shall help her in her journey to maximize her potential and become the best in the world. On this journey with her, we shall, together, inspire today’s youth to take to sports and create a positive change in and around their lives.”

Delighted about her relationship with adidas, Hima Das said: “I have always aspired to wear adidas shoes. In fact, I have been wearing them for the last few years and was wearing them during the Youth Championships and the Asian Games. I feel extremely proud to join the adidas family and be a part of a great group of global athletes. adidas has an incredible track record for helping athletes across sports and enabling them to reach the peak of their sport. With them, I hope to take my performances to the next level on the field, and also help create change off it. Our aim together is to improve participation of Indian youth in sports and women empowerment and I am confident of creating the change with adidas.”

In the last decade, adidas has been working with many young athletes and investing in grassroot initiatives to empower young athletes to take to sports. Some of the grassroot investments include the adidas Runners community, the Tango league and adidas Base for football, and adidas Junior Open in tennis.

Indian athletes such as Rohit Sharma, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Dipika Pallikal, Zeel Desai, Nikhat Zareen, Siddhanth Banthia, Manjot Kalra, along with international athletes like Lionel Messi, Paul Pogba, Naomi Osaka, Caroline Wozniacki, Wayde van Niekerk and Gladys Cherono among others wear the 3-Stripes with pride.

"Hima Das, Muhammed Anas, Dutee Chand win silver medals for team India","August 28, 2018","AFI Media
26 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Hima Das added an Asian Games silver to her list of achievements this year after she finished the women’s 400 metres final in Jakarta in a time of 50.79 seconds.

It was another national record for the sprinter from Assam, who broke her previous record of 51 seconds that she had set in the semi-finals on Saturday. Das, who had won the junior World title in Tampere, Finland last month, was also competing at her maiden Asiad and also won her first major international medal at the senior level.

Nirmala Sheoran, who also participated in the final, came close to a medal by finishing fourth, in a time of 52.96 seconds.

Muhammed Anas, the national record holder in the 400 metres, also won silver in the men’s section as he clocked a time of 45.69 seconds. Anas, who won his Heat and his semi-final yesterday, ran a fast race to claim his first Asian Games medal.

Also in the final was Arokia Rajiv, bronze medal winner from Incheon in 2014. The Tamil Nadu sprinter finished 0.14 seconds behind the third-placed finisher in fourth, and will now look forward to the 4X400 metre relay.

Dutee Chand won India’s third athletics medal of the day when she bagged a silver in the women’s 100 metres. Chand ran a fast race to secure second place with a time of 11.32 seconds.

Earlier, she had qualified for the final by finishing third in semi-final one, with a time of 11.43 seconds. Chand is also India’s national record holder with a time of 11.24 seconds.

Govindan Lakshmanan had finished third in the men’s 10,000 metres but was later disqualified for having stepped outside the curb. Had he not been stripped of his bronze medal, it would have been India’s first in the event since Bangkok 1998.

Sreeshankar Murali finished in sixth place in the Men’s Long Jump competition. The 19-year old registered a best jump of 7.95 metres, and he was temporarily in third place before being taken over by other jumpers. It was also his first major international competition and he had earlier qualified for the final with a single jump of 7.83 metres, ensuring automatic qualification.

Santosh Kumar and Ayyasamy Dharun also ensured that they qualified for the finals of the 400 metres hurdles by finishing second in their respective semi-finals. Dharun, who is also the national record holder with a time of 49.45 seconds, was close to the record, clocking 49.55 seconds in the semi-finals.

Anu Raghavan in the morning had clocked 56.77 seconds in her 400 metres hurdles heats and qualified for the final, along with Jauna Murmu.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hima-Das-Muhammed-Anas-Dutee-Chand-win-silver-medals-for-team-India.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/hima-das-muhammed-anas-dutee-chand-win-silver-medals-for-team-india/,Athletics

Hima Das is the new 400m World Junior Champion,"July 13, 2018","Hima Das created history at the U-20 World Athletics Championships in Tampere, Finland on Thursday, winning the women’s 400m to become the first Indian track athlete to win a gold medal at a global athletic event.  Das clocked 51.46 seconds to beat Romania’s Andrea Miklos who finished a distant second in 52.07 seconds while Taylor Manson of USA trailed further back to take bronze in 52.28 seconds. Das is only the second Indian athlete to have won a gold at the U-20 World Championships following javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra who won his title in the 2016 edition.

The 18-year-old from Assam was considered the odds on favourite to win the event having entered the competition as the fastest in the field. She didn’t show any sign of vulnerability in the competition, winning both her heat (with a time of 52.25 seconds) and the semifinal (with a time of 52.10 seconds).  She would only improve on that time in the final. Running in lane four in the final, Das appeared to have got off to a slow start and seemed to be under pressure at the first bend. She also appeared to be trailing behind the leaders at the 300m mark but kept a cool head and managed to reel them in steadily in the final stretch. She eventually win with a sizeable lead over her rivals.

Das’ victory is only the latest high point in a career that exploded ever since she first began her athletics career in 2016. Born in Dhing village of Assam, Das was originally a football player before she shifted her focus to athletics. Although a late starter, Das, first made a mark at the 2017 Youth Nationals and was subsequently picked for the Asian Youth Championships where she finished seventh and then took part at the World Youth Championships the same year where she finished 5th in the 200m.

Das shifted to the 400m soon after and continued to find success. She won the Asian Games Test event in February this year and subsequently qualified for the Commonwealth Games with a victory at the Federation Cup in March. Das was one of the stand out performers at the Gold Coast Games and nearly pulled off a huge upset before eventually settling for sixth in a high class field in the final of the 400m.

Das has since steadily improved, winning a gold medal at the Inter State Championships in June with a personal best time of 51.13 seconds. Although Das was not able to match that effort at the Ratina Stadium in Tampere, there will be little doubt that the gold medal will be a prize she will be more than satisfied with.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hima-Das-is-the-new-400m-World-Junior-Champion.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/hima-das-is-the-new-400m-world-junior-champion/,Athletics
Hima Das makes it to 400m semi-finals as fastest runner in heats at World U-20 Athletics,"July 11, 2018","TAMPERE (Finland): Indian Sprinter Hima Das made it to the semi-finals of the women’s 400m as the faster runner in the heats on the opening day of the IAAF World Under-20 Athletics Championships on Tuesday

The 18-year-old Das, a favourite to ein gold, clocked 52.25 seconds to win heat number four and lead the time charts. Running at lane number three, Das beat Stacey-Ann Williams of Jamaica (52.71) in the fastest of the five heats

Anoter Indian, Jisna mathew also qualified for the semi-finals by winning the fifth heat in 54.32 seconds

American Taylor Manson, a medal contender, finished overall second with a time of 52.68 seconds.She won heat number one.

The first four finishers in each heat and the next four fastest qualify for the semi-finals which will be run on Wednesday.

Das is a favourite to win gold as she is the U-20 season leader in this quartermile event. Assam girl happens to win gold, she will become the first Indian athlete to do so in a track event in an U-20 World Championships.

Das clocked an Indian U-20 record of 51.32 seconds to finish sixth in the Commonwealth Games 400m final in Gold Coast in April. Since then, she has gone onto improving her timings. She lowered the Indian U-20 record in 400m to 51.13
seconds while winning gold in the recent National Inter State Championships in Guwahati.

M Shreeshankar finished fourth in the qualification round of men’s long jump event with an effort of 7.68m to make it to the final round. Compatriot Lokesh Sathyanathan, however, finished 17th with a jump of 7.31m.

In men’s shotput, Asish Bholothia finished eight in Group A qualification round with a personal best throw 0f 18.62m but that was not enough to make it to the final round.

Hima Das the “one to beat” in IAAF World U20 Championships,"July 9, 2018","It is indeed a testament of ones greatness when one rises above the challenges they face, above the age old notion surrounding Indians in a particular discipline- above all of it to emerge as a legit contender for the top spot. Hima Das has managed to do that. Not really famed for their exploits in track athletics, it looks as if this year Hima Das would be the one to break that deadlock for Indian athletes. IAAF has already touted her as “the one to look out for” in the World U20 Championships.

Das burst into the forefront with a historic run at the 2018 Commonwealth games which saw her clock a personal best in the finals of the 400mt race. She registered a timing of 51.32s, to finish sixth in the final race. For the people watching back in India, Hima Das was already a star. Her quirks off the field made her as lovable as her blazing performance on the track did.

Now, we’re back to one of the biggest tournaments in athletics- the World u20 Championships. Indian prospects are bright. In the Men’s Long Jump, young M Sreeshankar had missed out on a Commonwealth Games berth due to an injury. He will be looking to make a mark on the world stage with an electrifying performance he is quite capable of. Sreeshankar’s personal best is a whopping 7.99mts in his event. The 2016 Gold medalist in his event at the U20 World Championships registered a distance of 8.00mts while the U20 World Record is 8.35mts.

Coming back to Hima Das, recently, she set a new Indian record bettering her previous timing of 51.32s and lowering it down to 51.13 over 400m and 23.10 for 200m. 51.32s was the timing of the 2016 U20 Women’s 400mt Gold medalist so Hima clearly has a wonderful chance of emerging right at the top of the fray.

In fact the only other athlete competing this year in the Women’s 400mt who has registered a timing under 52 seconds is 19-year old Roxana Gomez from Cuba. Granted she has a lot more experience than Hima Das but the Assam born girl has never let that stop her. From running without any formal training in the muddy fields of Assam, she has now become one of India’s best hopes for medals at the highest level.

Objectively speaking, we do not have too much time left for the Tokyo Olympics. India’s performance in the U20 World Championships and the final standings will surely be a huge criteria that all future Olympics preparation should be based on.

Hima Das leads 31 strong contingent to Junior World Championships,"July 5, 2018","New Delhi. Tipped to bring back an elusive track medal for the country at the World Junior Championships, quarter miler Hima Das will be leading a squad of 31 Indian athletes – 21 men and 10 women — to the IAAF U20 World Junior Championships to be held in the Finnish city of Tampere between 10th and 15th of July 2018.

The 18-year-old Das, has been going from strength to strength ever since she first broke into the national scene with a pair of medals at the Indian U-18 Youth Nationals in February 2018. Although Das had won just a silver and bronze in that tournament, she has made a name for herself as the fastest active athlete over the 200 and 400m in India. The athlete from Dhing village in Assam has even made a mark in international competition with an impressive sixth place finish in the 400m event at the Commonwealth Games in April this year. Das is in red hot form heading into the competition in Finland, having won the 400m title at the Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati last month.

Her winning time of 51.13 seconds makes her one of the form favourites for the Junior Worlds with only one other athlete – USA’s Sydney McLaughlin – having recorded a faster time this year.

Das is not the only athlete who will be expecting to compete for medals at the World Championships. Among the men, junior national record holder M Sreeshankar would be carrying the most responsibility. The long jumper’s personal best of 7.99m set at the Federation Cup in March this year is the fourth best jump by a Junior athlete this year. However, Sreeshankar suffered a setback when he suffered a severe case of appendicitis shortly after his record-breaking jump in Patiala. The Kerala athlete however has managed to regain some of his lost form winning a bronze medal at the Asian Junior Championships in Gifu last month with an effort of 7.47m. Sreeshankar will have company in Tampere as compatriot Satyanathan Lokesh has also been named to the squad. Lokesh goes into the competition in 11th place amongst junior athletes this season with a season’s best of 7.74m recorded at the South Asian Junior Championships in May.

Also looking to carry on some form from the Asian Junior championships would be the hammer throw pair of Ashish Jhakar and Damneet Singh who took first and second place at the tournament in Gifu last month. Jhakhar’s throw of 76.86m places him sixth amongst junior athletes this season while Singh’s season’s best of 74.08 places him eleventh. Despite a slightly shorter throw, Singh would be carrying a bit of confidence of competing and winning at the international level, having clinched a silver medal at the World Youth Championships in Nairobi last year.

Competing under a bit of pressure would be javelin thrower Sahil Silwal. The 18-year-old has big shoes to fill. He will be looking to emulate senior compatriot Neeraj Chopra, who at the 2016 edition of the tournament in Bydgoszcz, set a new junior world record with a throw of 86.48m to became the first Indian to win a gold medal at an IAAF world event.

Silwal’s best is 74.88m that he recorded last month in Kuortane Motonet GP in Finland. The mark places him fifth amongst junior javelin throwers. However, Silwal’s coach Uwe Hohn has tipped the youngster to cross the 80m mark soon and Tampere would be as good a tournament as any to create a new personal best.

Heading into the competition full of confidence would be middle distance runner Beant Singh. Marked out for success at an early age following a silver medal in the 800m at the Open Nationals in 2014 and then a gold medal at the Asian Youth Championships the following year, Beant suffered a series of injuries that caused his career to falter. An exit in the heats at the 2016 Junior World championships in a sub-par time of 1:51.73 seconds was a particular low point. The Haryana athlete though has found some momentum once again clocking 1:46.92 seconds in a fourth-place finish at last month’s Inter State Championships. That timing is the seventh fastest in amongst junior athletes this year.

Elakkiyadasan and Sneha emerge Fastest Runners of National Games,"October 29, 2023","AFI Media

Goa

Elakkiyadasan VK of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka’s Sneha SS were victorious in the men’s and women’s 100m dash on the opening day of track and field of the 37th National Games here on Sunday.

Both the fastest runners of the competition were slow off the blocks but shifted into top gears in the last 20 meters to win gold medals in their respective groups. Elakkiyadasan’s gold medal winning time was 10.36 seconds, while Sneha clocked 11.45 seconds.

Earlier, Hangzhou Asian Games bronze medalist in men’s 10,000m, Gulveer Singh, representing Services, claimed first track and field gold of the National Games by winning the men’s 5,000m title.

Sneha was excited with her performance on Sunday. “My start was ok, but It was a good finish,” Sneha said in the post-race interaction.

The competitors in the men’s 5,000m final played a waiting game. At least five athletes were in contention for the medal until the last 100m of the race.

The Services distance runner found top gear when it mattered most. He crossed the finish line with a time of 14 minutes 13.03 seconds to add National Games 5000m gold to his kitty.

Gujarat’s international runner Gavit Murli Kumar was close second. His silver medal winning time was 14:13.14 secs.

It was a proud moment for Goa as Ajay Kumar won bronze with a time of 14:13.33 secs.

“I ran for the medal today and not for the time,” Gulveer Singh said. “My next goal is to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.”

As expected, Olympian and Asian Games medalist Seema Punia comfortably won the women’s discus throw gold with a distance of 52.51m.

In the women’s 10,000m race, Seema of Himachal Pradesh surged ahead of her arch rival Sanjivani Jadhav of Maharashtra in the last lap to win the gold medal with a time of 33:20.75 seconds. Sanjivani settled for silver.

Tajinderpal Toor steals Elakkiyadasan and Srabani Nanda’s thunder at National Open Championships,"October 16, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 16: VK Elakkiyadasan (Railways) and Odisha’s Srabani Nanda emerged the fastest man and woman respectively in the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on a rain-hit evening here today. But it was Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Services) who grabbed the attention of fans and connoisseurs alike.

With an opening effort of 20.68m, Tajinderpal Singh Toor not only made it difficult for his rivals at the Shot Put circle but also stole the thunder from men and women’s winners of the glamorous 100m, 400m and 1500m events. He had two more Puts over 20m mark on a day when Karanveer Singh was the only other athlete to heave the iron ball past that line.

The 27-year-old Elakkiyadasan led the men’s 100m from start to finish, winning in 10.37 seconds to beat Services’ Harjit Singh to a distant second. The 18-year-old Shivam Vashnav (Delhi) who had created quite a buzz with a good run in the semifinals, did not find his rhythm after being slow off the blocks and finished eight.

Srabani Nanda, 31, trailed at the 50m mark but sustained her pace long enough to win the women’s sprint by a hundredth of a second from Himashree Roy (Railways). Diandra Dudely Valladares (Maharashtra) trailed off to fifth place, unable to capitalise on a blazing start. Hima Das (Assam) was in the frame till 80m but slowed down palpably.

Tamil Nadu’s 23-year-old Subha Venkatesan scorched the track in winning the women’s 400m in a personal best time of 52.57 seconds. Soniya Baishya (Railways) also produced a personal best in her first sub-54 second effort since 2019 to take the second place. Her team-mate R Vithya Ramraj, who had topped the qualification, came in fifth in 53.88 seconds.

The men’s quarter-mile podium was bereft of Services sprinters as Railways claimed a one-two through 23-year-old Rajesh Ramesh (46.63 seconds) and Ayush Dabas (46.86). Karnataka’s Nihal Joel left the three Services runners, Mijo Chacko Kurian, Angrej Singh and Rahul Baby, in his wake to take the bronze medal.

The 17-year-old Parvej Khan provided Services some cheer with a well-earned victory in the men’s 1500m. Lying fifth with 100m to go, he kicked on from the outside to win by two-hundredths of a second from a pair of Madhya Pradesh runners, Abhiskeh Singh Thakur and Ritesh Ohre even as Satya Dev (Haryana) sprawled on the track barely 5m from the finish.

In the women’s metric mile, Madhya Pradesh’s KM Deeksha sprinted past Ankita Dhyani (Railways) for a memorable maiden win this season.

The Railways trio of Swapna Barman, Sowmiya Murugan and Sonu Kumari swept to the podium at the end of the two-day Heptathlon competition. Swapna Barman topped five of the seven events to run out a comfortable winner by more than 400 points.

Hima wins semifinal-1 to enter final of 400m at IAAF U20 worlds,"July 11, 2018","Bidding to become the first Indian track athlete to win a medal at the Junior World Championships, Hima Das qualified for the final of the women’s 400m at Tampere on Wednesday. Das won the first of three semifinals in the Ratina Stadium, clocking a time of 52.10 seconds. She however was far slower than her personal best of 51.13 seconds recorded at the Inter State Championships in Guwahati last month.

Das though, was by far the fastest athlete across the three semifinals on Wednesday and will be favourite to win the final on Thursday. Andrea Miklos finished in second place with a time of 52.48 seconds. Taylor Manson of USA who is expected to provide the toughest challenge to Das won her semifinal in 53 seconds while Ella Connolly of Australia won the final semifinal in 52.78 seconds.

There would however be disappointment for the other Indian running the 400m semifinals. Jisna Mathew finished fifth in the second semifinal clocking a time of 53.86 seconds. That was short of her season’s best of 53.26 seconds that she had recorded en route the 400m gold at the Junior Asian Championships in Japan last month and well short of per personal best of 52.65 seconds.

Das though was not the only Indian to qualify for the final of her event. Earlier in the day, Ashish Jakhar also made it to the final of the hammer throw (6kg) event at Tampere’s Ratina Stadium. The 19-year-old booked his place with a throw of 70.52m. That mark placed him in eighth place of a total of 12 qualiefiers who will compete in the in the final to be held on Friday.

Jakhar, was in strong form coming into the tournament, having won a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships with a national record setting effort of 76.86m. He would not come near that mark in Tampere though. After fouling his first effort in Tampere, he recorded a throw of 70.52m in his second attempt before finishing his day with a throw of 70.33m. Jakhar though will have to throw close or improve on his personal best if he is to give himself a chance of a podium finish. Britain’s Jake Norris leads the field with a throw of 76.95m.

There would be little to cheer for Damneet Singh, the other Indian in the hammer throw competition. Singh had won a silver medal at the 2017 World Youth Championships but could not find anywhere close to that form on Wednesday. Singh had a best throw of 67.48m to finish 14th in a 31 athlete competition. Damneet would be particularly disappointed for he had come into the competition with a season’s best throw of 74.08m that that won him a silver medal at the Asian Junior Championships last month.

Also failing to advance was 400m sprinter Gaurav. The 19-year-old from Haryana finished fifth in his heat to crash out of the competition with only the top three in each heat and the three fastest losers advancing to the semifinals of the World Championships. Gaurav clocked a disappointing 48.61seconds, nearly two seconds shy of his personal best of 46.93 seconds that he had set en route a gold medal at the Junior Federation Cup in Coimbatore in April.

Earlier, on the first day of the competition on Tuesday,  AshishBhalothia bettered his personal best with an 18.62m effort in the men’s shot put, but that was not enough to carry him into the 12-man final as he finished 14th overall. There was also disappointment in the men’s 1500m heat with Ankit, who has a personal best of 3:47.89s, finishing 12th in his heat in a poor 4:05.15s.Also failing to make the final was M.

29 June 2018

Guwahati. Hima Das claimed the bragging rights on the final day of the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships by winning the marquee women’s 400m race in Guwahati on Friday.

The 18-year-old clocked 51.13 seconds to pip Haryana’s Nirmla Sheoran to the top of the podium at the Indira Gandhi Stadium.

Das, who had earlier won the 200m appeared to be in trouble with Sheoran having opened up a sizable lead at the final bend. Yet Das, running in lane 5 powered through the final stretch to catch up with Sheoran, running in lane 3, before pulling ahead in the final few meters of the race. Das’ time was a new personal best for her. Her previous best was a time of 51.32 seconds, that had seen her finish sixth at the Commonwealth Games. Das also set a new meet record, erasing the previous mark of 51.48 seconds set by Sheoran at the 2016 edition of the Championships. Sheoran meanwhile clocked 51.25m, just .03 seconds off her own personal best of 51.22 seconds. Prachi of Uttar Pradesh came third with a time of 52.96 seconds.

Other sprinters who crossed the qualifying standards set by AFI for Asian Games were Dutee Chand, in the women’s 100m and men’s 400m athlete Arokia Rajiv. Chand booked her spot for the quadrennial event in the morning session itself. Competing in the semifinal of her event, the 22-year-old from Odisha set the track ablaze with a new national record of 11.29 seconds. The AFI’s qualification guideline stood at 11.67 seconds. Chand erased the old national mark, which was also her previous personal best of 11.30 seconds set in New Delhi last year. Chand though couldn’t improve on her national record in the finals of the 100m, although her time of 11.32 seconds was more than enough to take gold. Finishing behind Chand was K Ranga of Manipur who clocked a credible 11.70 seconds while Karnataka’s Reena George claimed bronze with 11.77 seconds.

Arokia Rajiv meanwhile clocked a solid 45.78 seconds to finish under the AFI standard of 46.04 seconds. The 27-year-old from Tamil Nadu finished ahead of Kerala’s Kunhu Muhammad, who clocked 46.30 seconds and Karnataka’s Jeevan KS who took bronze with a time of 46.37 seconds.

Creating some happy headaches for the selectors were the top four athletes in the women’s 1500m, who all recorded times faster than the Asian Games qualifying standard of 4:16.88 seconds. PU Chitra of Kerala claimed the gold medal in 4:11.55 seconds, closely followed by 19-year-old Monika Choudhary of Uttar Pradesh who stopped the watch at 4:12.44 seconds. Jhuma Khatun of Uttar Pradesh claimed bronze with a time of 4:12.84 seconds while West Bengal’s Lili Das also finished inside the Asian Games standard with a time of 4:13.12 seconds.

Two more athletes would manage to clear the AFI’s qualification standards in the men’s triple jump. Arpinder Singh, cleared 17m after a gap of four years, winning the event with a jump of 17.09m. Also managing to get the better of the Asian Games standard of 16.62m was Kerala’s Rakesh Babu who cleared 16.63m to finish second. Mohamad Salahu of Tamil Nadu took bronze with a best effort of 16.32m.

Two heptathletes also managed to earn a call up for the Asian Games. With the qualifying standard set at 5400 points, Odisha’s Purnima Hembram, who took gold in Guwahati with 5898 points and West Bengal’s Swapna Barman who claimed a silver with a total of 5725 points managed to book their passage to Jakarta. Falling just short by six points was M Sowmya of Andhra Pradesh who tallied 5394 points.

There would be a touch of nerves for Jinson Johnson as he fell just short of the AFI guidelines in the men’s 1500 event. Johnson who broke the 42-year-old Indian record in the 800m just a couple of days ago, claimed gold in the 1500m with a time of 3:45.12 seconds. Johnson was just .12 seconds off the Asian Games standard of 3:45.00 seconds. Johnson finished ahead of Manjit Singh of Haryana who clocked 3:46.08 and Asian Championship gold medalist Ajay Kumar Saroj who clocked 3:46.91 seconds.

The selection committee will meet at 5pm tomorrow at AFI headquarters in Delhi to select the Indian team for the Asian Games 2018.

"All eyes on Hima, Anas ahead of Inter State athletics","June 25, 2018","AFI Media
25 June 2018

Guwahati. With spots in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games up for grabs, the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships, beginning June 26th in Guwahati, is expected to be a keenly contested affair.

While a few high profile names including Commonwealth gold medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and Commonwealth silver medalist discus thrower Seema Antil have been granted exemption from participation, the track section of the four day long competition should likely throw up some big results.  This will be largely due to the strict qualification guidelines — equivalent to top-4 or top-5 performance of the last Asian Games in almost all the events – and the fact that several athletes have been delivering strong performances in recent weeks.

Multiple Asian gold medalist PT Usha said the women’s 400m would in particular be an event to watch out for. “The competition in certain track events will be really strong here in Guwahati as athletes are well prepared. Since it is the final selection trial, athletes are determined to give their best. Hima Das has produced some really good results this year and I hope she will continue this for the rest of the season,” Usha said.

The 18-year-old Das is expected to be the highlight of what will be her home event. Das has improved dramatically in recent months. The Assam sprinter clocked a personal best of 23.22 seconds in the 200m in Poland earlier this month while she ran 51.32 seconds in 400m during the Gold Coast CWG. “”I have just returned from Poland where we went for month long training and I am feeling good. I am fully prepared for Inter State,” Das said.

Yet Das will face tough competition in both events. In 200m, she will compete against the likes of Dutee Chand and Srabani Nanda  while Asian championship gold medalist Nirmala Sheoran, who has a personal best of 51.28 seconds,  is expected to pose a serious threat. With veterans M R Poovamma and Jauna Murmu coming into form and teenager Jisna Mathew fresh off a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships, there are sure to be fireworks on the track.

Amongst the athletes to watch out for in the men’s section will be quartermiler Muhammad Anas. The 23-year-old who broke the national record during the Gold Coast CWG with an effort of 45.31 seconds, will also be competing in the 200m.

The results of the two 400m races will be particularly fascinating owing to the fact that the selectors would also be picking the team for the 4x400m mixed relay, to be held for the first time at the Asian Games this time. India has a decent chance to win a gold in this event.

In the long-distance section, plenty of eyes would be on 21-year-old Gavit Murli Kumar, who became the second fastest Indian in 10,000m with a 28:43.34 sec effort at the Gouden Spike Meet earlier this month, would want to show that his impressive display was no fluke. Murli, who is also competing in the 5000m race, though will not have it easy with double Asian gold medalist G Lakshmanan and T Gopi also in the fray.

An additional item of interest to the competition would be the return to the track of steeplechaser Lalita Babar. The 29-year-old former Asian Games bronze medalist had been out of action for over a year following her marriage but will be hoping to make up for lost time at the Indira Gandhi athletics stadium.

“We are expecting a very high level of competition this year in Inter State championships. The weather in Guwahati is perfect for athletes. I want to thank Honorable CM of Assam Shri Sarbananda Sonwal for providing such good facilities to all the teams and our National Campers here in Guwahati,” said CK Valson.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/All-eyes-on-Hima-Anas-ahead-of-Inter-State-athletics.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/all-eyes-on-hima-anas-ahead-of-inter-state-athletics/,Athletics
Hima finishes sixth with personal best timing at CWG final,"April 11, 2018","AFI Media
11 April 2018

Gold Coast. Hima Das showed no nerves in what was her first ever final at the Commonwealth Games, finishing sixth in the women’s 400m with a creditable time of 51.32seconds. 18-year-old Das, who had only began undertaking formal coaching about a year ago and only started running the 400m a few months back, performed impressively on the biggest stage of her career. Das in fact finished with an identical time as the fifth place finisher Maximila Imali but placed behind in the photo finish.

What was particularly impressive about Das was that she has showed consistent improvement over her short career. She had run the semifinal heat with a time of 51.53 seconds which lasted as her personal best for a little less than a day. On the day of the final, Das was running in the first lane of what was a world level field and stayed close to the chasing pack after former world champion Amantle Montsho had taken the early lead. Montsho’s gold was never in question as she clocked a time of 50.15 seconds with Anastasia Leroy taking second with a time of 50.57 seconds. Stephanie McPherson took third with 50.93 seconds. However Das stayed within touching distance of fourth place Christine BotLogetswe who finished just .15 seconds ahead of her with a time of 51.17 seconds.

While the medal might have been out of reach, Das certainly showed she will be a force to watch out for in the coming years.

Das was not the only young Indian in the final. Tejaswin Shankar had qualified for the final of the men’s high jump where he finished after clearing a height of 2.24m. Shankar who started strongly, clearing 2.18m with his very first jump, cleared heights of 2.21 and was one of seven jumpers who managed to clear 2.24m. However the height of 2.27m would prove too much for him on the day. Shankar, a 19-year-old college student at Kansas State University, had a personal best of 2.28m, recorded twice this year but fell just short of that at the Carrara stadium.

The gold in the event was won by Australia’s Brandon Starc, younger brother of Australian cricketer Mitchell Starc, who cleared a personal best of 2.32m while silver and bronze went to Jamal Wilson and Django Lovett who both cleared 2.30m with Wilson winning by virtue of clearing that height in fewer attempts.

Earlier in the day, two Indian athletes also managed to qualify for the final of the women’s long jump competition. Nayana James and V Neena managed to advance from the qualifying rounds after only four contestants managed to clear the automatic qualifying standard of 6.60m. James who has a personal best of 6.55m managed to clear 6.34m in her second attempt. Neena was not sure of qualifying until her final attempt when she managed to leap a distance of 6.27m to qualify in the 12th and final spot.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hima-finishes-sixth-with-personal-best-timing-at-CWG-final.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/hima-finishes-sixth-with-personal-best-timing-at-cwg-final/,Athletics
"Anas betters National Record at CWG, Hima enters final","April 10, 2018","AFI Media
10 April 2018

Gold Coast. After two days of disappointment, the athletics track finally came alive for India at the Commonwealth Games 2018 in Gold Coast- Australia. Mohammad Anas Yahiya ran the race of his lifetime in the final of the 400m at the Carrara stadium and shattered the national record to finish fourth in a world class field. Running in lane 7, Anas clocked 45.31 seconds to erase the old mark, his own incidentally of 45.31 seconds recorded last year.

Running on a track that had just received a shower and slowed down, Anas remained within touching distance of his competitors before falling .2 of a second short of the bronze medal position of 45.11 seconds which was set by Javon Francis of Jamaica. Botswana’s Isaac Makwala and Baboloki Thebe took gold and silver with a time of 44.35 and 45.09 respectively.

The result exhausted Anas who had impressed just in qualifying for the finals on Tuesday. “I am really tired. I just want to sleep now,” he said in the media room. After his exhilarating performance, the 23-year-old from Kerala has certainly earned a good night’s sleep.

While Anas might have missed out on a medal, Hima Das has a very good chance of putting herself in the record books herself. Das, running in her first Commonwealth Games, ran a breathtaking personal best time of 51.53 seconds to finish third in the first semifinal heat. With only the top two runners from each heat qualifying for the finals, Das had to wait for the results of the other two semifinals to know her fate. It would be just about enough as Das Qualified for the final as one of the two fastest losers in the semifinals. Das’ timing however was the seventh fastest of the eight finalists.

It was a remarkable achievement for an athlete who had not begun training formally until a year ago and only started running the 400m a few months back. The 18-year-old from Assam had initially wanted to be a football player. However she has managed to improve with every competition. Her semifinal timing of 51.53 shaved .44 seconds off her previous best of 51.97seconds set at the Federation Cup in March. Next in sight will be Manjit Kaur’s national record of 51.05 seconds set in 2004.

Das might have only qualified for the final in seventh place but her improvement has been remarkable and few would want to predict her time in the final.

Dharun Ayyasamy was the third Indian on the track on the day. Although he didn’t advance out of the heats in the men’s 400m relay event, Ayyasamy, the national record holder finished just shy of qualification for the semifinals with a time of 49.85 seconds. Although the result was not the one Ayyasamy, who’s national record stands at 49.54 seconds would have wanted, it was a creditable achievement for the 21-year-old who has only recently recovered from a bout of typhoid just a few weeks back.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/19.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/anas-betters-national-record-at-cwg-hima-enters-final/,Athletics
"Youngsters Neeraj, Hima and co. set to shine at the big stage","April 5, 2018","With India beginning its journey at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Thursday, three weightlifters are expected to deliver the first medals of the campaign. While Mirabai Chanu is expected to be dominant in the women’s 48kg category, keep an eye out for Muthupandi Raja in the men’s 62kg category as well.

At 18 years and five months, Raja is the youngest of the competitors in his division. Only just last year, he was competing in the boy’s category at the Commonwealth Championships where he won a gold.

However, Raja isn’t the youngest amongst his compatriots. That would be 69-kg competitor Deepak Lather, who is two months younger, and a bronze medallist competing in the senior category at the Commonwealth Championships.

Raja and Lather are just two of several Indian athletes in their teens — 28 in all — or barely out of it, who will be competing for medals in Gold Coast. They aren’t just there to make up the numbers either. Neeraj Chopra, 20, currently holds the best throw among javelin throwers from the Commonwealth participants this year and is India’s best bet in the field events, while quartermiler Hima Das (18) will be the driving force in the women’s 4x400m team. 19-year-old Divya Kakran too will be looking to add to her gold medal in the women’s 68kg wrestling competition.

The most precocious youngsters though, are to be found in the shooting squad.

Three members of the team — Manu Bhaker, Mehuli Ghosh and Anish Bhanwala are teenagers. All of them are favoured to win their respective events. Competing in the women’s 10m pistol event, 16-year-old Manu Bhaker is the youngest Indian competitor at Gold Coast and is coming off winning two gold medals at the ISSF World Cup in Mexico. Mehuli Ghosh, 17, won a bronze at the same tournament in the women’s 10m rifle. Bhanwala, 16, is fresh off a gold medal in the men’s 25m rapid fire pistol at the World Cup in Sydney. All three were competing in their first World Cup. “A new era in Indian shooting,” was how Abhinav Bindra described those performances.

Jaspal Rana, coach of the Indian junior shooting team — no stranger to early success himself (he won a World Championship gold when he was 18) — says young athletes have an inherent advantage. “You are fresh, new and have nothing to lose. You aren’t putting any pressure on yourself at this age,” he says.

That self belief has also been noticed by Olympian and the only Indian athlete to win a World Championships medal, Anju Bobby George. “Perhaps we were more hardworking, but the youngsters you see now are more bold,” she says. She remains astounded by the success of 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar, who after being introduced to the sport by a Physical Education teacher, picked up skills essentially over YouTube, much like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra did. Shankar would go on to pack his bags and participate in collegiate athletics in the USA. “We would stick to doing only what our coaches told us. Our generation didn’t even know about such things like social media or how to use it to improve ourselves. Perhaps we wouldn’t even have thought of that,” she says.

India has had talented youngsters before. Most of them faded away, unable to carry their success into the seniors. Shooting had been a prime example of this with tales of unfulfilled promise to be found aplenty. Navnath Fartade won a junior world Championship gold in 2006 and subsequently a bronze at the Doha Asian Games, but is out of the national reckoning today.

The current generation though has it a lot smoother. Jaspal Rana believes the shift began about six years ago, when the national federation put in place a robust plan for supporting youngsters with the bulk (approximately 60 percent of funding) going towards them. “The funds are being given to the junior program. There is a proper system that’s been in place for the last six-seven years. Manu, Mehuli and Anish haven’t come up suddenly. There has been systematic training that has been responsible for their success.”

Despite the success that they have enjoyed recently, Rana says it’s best to remain cautious about their future. “We need to keep them grounded at this age. It is not fair to expect them to perform every time. You have to accept that they won’t get the results every time. In India, we have a habit of bringing them up very quickly and bringing them down very quickly.”

The youngsters themselves aren’t overthinking about the upcoming few days. “A part of me is excited that I will be competing against some of the best runners in the world,” says 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be part of the 4x400m relay squad. The team will face a tough task going against a Bahamas side that features Worlds silver medalist Steve Gardiner, a Botswana team that featured two finalists in the 400m at the World Championships and the defending relay world champion team from Trinidad and Tobago.

"Lakshmanan, Suriya, Hima, Sheena lead Indian gold medal run at Asian Games test event","February 13, 2018","Jakarta, Feb13: Lakshmanan Govindan and Loganathan Suriya made it two in two for India in the 5000m at the athletics event of the Asian Games invitational tournament in Jakarta on Tuesday. Govindan, who hails from Pudukottai in Tamil Nadu had been adopted by Suriya’s father – the athletics coach S Loganathan. He has long carved a niche for himself as India’s premier long distance runner and is the current Asian champion in the 5000 and 10000m. The 28-year-old added to his already impressive body of work at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium. Competing in his first tournament of the season Lakshmanan clocked 13.56.30 seconds to finish ahead of Takanori Ichikawa of Japan who was nearly a half minute behind with a time of 14:19:10 seconds.

Suriya on the other hand was the only runner in the field. Without anyone to push or pace her, the 28-year-old might hardly have expected to challenge herself. However, Suriya recorded a career best time of 15:39:18secands, shaving nearly seven seconds of her previous best of 15:46:92 seconds recorded in Guntur last year. The mark was good enough to allow her to meet the Asian Games qualification standard of 15 minutes 45 seconds. However Suriya’s target for now would be next month’s Federation Cup which will serve as a qualification tournament for the Commonwealth Games. With the cream of Indian athletes taking part, Suriya would be able to push herself even further.

Lakshmanan and Suriya’s gold medals were just two of the four gold medals India won on the third day of athletics events in Jakarta. NV Sheena claimed a gold medal in the women’s triple jump while Hima Das finished ahead of the field in the women’s 200m race. Das, is one of the brightest talents in the women’s sprints events having finished fifth in the women’s 200m at Youth World championships in Nairobi last year. She is also won the National Open Championships. In Jakarta, the 18-year-old Das would clock 23.59 seconds to finish ahead of Ulfa Silpiana of Indonesia who was nearly a second behind with 24.86. Das, competing in her first tournament of the year recorded a new career best, beating her previous fastest mark of 24. 26 recorded at the National Open Athletics Championships in Chennai last year.

NV Sheena was always ahead of the field in the women’s triple jump and was well clear of the pack with her second jump of 13.33m. Sri Lanka’s Vidusha Heenatimullage came close with her final attempt of 13.28m but no other jumper crossed the 13m mark. It was the second medal for the 26-year-old Sheena who has had a prolific year having won the silver medal, also in the triple jump at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in February.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/lakshmanan-suriya-hima-sheena-lead-indian-gold-medal-run-at-asian-games-test-event/,Athletics
"Amlan, Sreeshankar and Jyothi mark domestic season debut with facile victories","April 10, 2023","AFI Media

Bengaluru, April 10: Sprinter Amlan Borgohain (Assam), Long Jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) and 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh) made their first appearance in a domestic competition this year memorable by winning gold in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 3 Athletics competition at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today.

Amlan Borgohain, 24, claimed the 100-200 double. Having taken a break after the Asian Indoor Championships in February, he returned to outdoor competition and sustained his acceleration to clock 10.50 seconds and win by two-hundredths of a second from Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha). He returned to the track less than an hour later to take the 200m in 21.20 seconds.

Commonwealth Games silver medalist Sreeshankar, whose last competition was the National Games in October 2022, produced three efforts that were good for gold today. The World No. 6 won with a leap of 7.94m on his last try. He was satisfied with his efforts since he is coming back from a grade 2 hamstring injury that kept him on the sidelines for three months.

Like Amlan Borgohain, Jyothi Yarraji took a break from competing after the Asian Indoor Championships and marked her return in the same venue where she rewrote the National Record at 12.82 seconds. She cruised to a win, clocking an easy 13.44 seconds, suggesting that India’s only sub-13 second hurdler was focusing on getting the technique right at the start of a big season.

Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra) became the third Indian woman 400m sprinter to clock a sub-54 seconds time twice this year. She won the event today in 53.63 seconds, leaving Kiran Pahal (Haryana) in her wake. Muhammed Ajmal won the men’s quarter-mile in 46.63 seconds, his best effort of the year and the third time he has gone below 47 seconds in 2023.

Hima Das, who had to endure a disqualification for a false start in the Indian Grand Prix 2 in Thiruvananthapuram, bounced back to win the women’s 200m while GK Vijayakumari (Karnataka) returned to a national-level 800m after five years and beat Madhya Pradesh’s KM Deeksha with a surge over the last 100m.

Halfmiler Krishan Kumar and Long Jumper Ancy Sojan steal the thunder in Indian GP 1,"March 20, 2023","AFI Media

Thiruvananthapuram, March 20: Haryana’s Krishan Kumar stepped up the pace approaching the halfway mark and topped the men’s 800m in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 1 at the Laxmibai National College of Physical Education here today. In clocking 1:47.26, his second best time over the distance, the Armyman met the Asian Games qualifying standard of 1:49.05.

Krishan Kumar, National Games silver medalist,. also owed it to Madhya Pradesh 18-year-old Parvej Khan who ran a hard first 300m and set the pace for the taller Krishan Kumar to utilise to his advantage. Parvej, who finished third in race A in 1:51.10, missed out on a podium place as Prakash Balu Gadade won race B in 1:50.56 and claimed the silver medal postion.

The men’s 5000m saw three Uttar Pradesh runners come home inside the Asian Games qualifying mark of 14:00.00. Abhishek Pal won in 13:51.14, 2.15 seconds slower than his personal best, while Gulveer Singh clocked a personal best, improving on the earlier time of 14:02.50 and Mohammed Nur Hasan, known as a Steeplechaser, marked his 25-lapper debut with an impressive 13:52.26

On a day on which Hima Das won the 200m quite comfortably in 23.79 seconds, it was Long Jumper Ancy Sojan who stole the thunder in the women’s events. She produced a series of leaps beyond 6.00m and won with a best effort of 6.49m, just past the 6.45m mark laid down as the Asian Games qualifying standard.

Odisha Javelin Thrower Kishore Kumar produced only two valid tries today but his effort of 81.05m is his career best, improving on the 78.93m in winning the National Open Throws Competition in Bellary this month. DP Manu tried hard to dislodge him from the top spot and had two throws over 80m but finished second. Both got the Asian Games qualifying mark.

Rosy Meena Paulraj rewrites women’s Pole Vault National record for second time in a fortnight,"October 15, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 15: Rosy Meena Paulraj (Tamil Nadu) broke the National record for women’s Pole Vault for the second time in 15 days when she cleared 4.21m to win gold on the opening day of the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today.

With her confidence soaring after claiming the National record at the National Games in IIT Gandhinagar on October 1, the Tamil Nadu vaulter gave herself another early birthday present today. She will look back at this month with a lot of fondness when she turns 25 a fortnight later.

Railways’ Ravina found redemption after some disappointing performances after starting the year by being part of the Indian team which became the first to win a medal at the World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships in Muscat. She won the women’s 20km Race Walk today with a new meet record time to boot.

With Amlan Borgohain staying away, Delhi’s 19-year-old Shivam Vashnav ensured that some of the spotlight would remain on the 100m sprints. When he clocked 10.74 seconds in the first round,there was no indication of what was to follow. He blazed the track to win his semifinal in 10.47 seconds and be the fastest qualifier for the final.

Himashree Roy (West Bengal) and Srabani Nanda were the fastest qualifiers for the final, clocking 11.52 seconds and 11.53 seconds respectively. Though Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh) did not finish her 100m first round, Hima Das (Assam) battled through two rounds (11.74 and 11.78) to remain in the mix.

Services’ Mijo Chacko Kurian and Angrej Singh set up an engrossing men’s 400m final along with Railways’ Ayush Dabas and Rajesh Ramesh. The women’s quarter-mile final will feature Subha Venkatesan (Tamil Nadu) and R Vithya Ramran as the fastest qualifiers. With six runners qualifying with sub-54 second times, the final can be a very competitive race.

The results (finals):

Men

20km Race Walk: 1. Suraj Panwar (Uttarakhand) 1:25:23.00; 2. Akshdeep Singh (Punjab) 1:25:26.00; 3. Paramjeet Singh Bisht (Services) 125:27.00.

New Delhi- A 32-member Indian athletics team comprising 17 men and 15 women athletes is all set to compete in the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham from July 28 to August 8, 2022. The larger Indian athletics contingent compared to 26 athletes in the previous edition of the Games at Gold Coast will start its campaign with men’s Marathon on Saturday.

Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President said, “The Indian team is full of young athletes and it is a great chance for these youngsters to shine at the CWG. We have a good team of 32 athletes though our quota for the Games was 36. Injury concerns forced Olympic Champion and 2018 CWG gold medallist in javelin throw Neeraj Chopra and shot putter Tajinder Singh Toor to pull out of the Games. In 4x400m men’s relay team, we have replaced Rajesh Ramesh who has minor injury and could not perform as expected at the World Championships with Mohammed Anas,”
“Two female athletes are dropped from the team after they failed a dope test. We have zero tolerance for doping. I am also pleased that entry of high jumper Tejaswin Shankar has been accepted by the Games organising committee. Overall, we are expecting a good performance from these youngsters and we want them to give their best and win more medals for India,” he said.

Indian had won three medals (1 gold, 1 bronze, 1 silver) in the last edition of the Games at Gold Coast, Australia in 2018.

Praveen Chithravel rewrites Triple Jump Meet Record with 17.18m effort,"June 15, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 14: Tamil Nadu’s Praveen Chithravel rewrote the Meet Record with a Triple Jump effort over 17.18m, third best by an Indian, on an action-packed final day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. He improved on Arpinder Singh’s meet mark of 17.14m set in Lucknow eight years ago. 

India’s season leader Abdulla Aboobacker ensured that it would be a high-octane final by charging himself up to hop, step and jump to 17.14m on his fifth try. That prompted Praveen, who had passed his fifth jump, to return to the runway but he recorded a third foul. Abdulla Aboobacker tried hard but managed 16.98m on his final attempt.

It was the second time inside a month that two Indians had crossed the 17m in the same competition. Abdulla Aboobacker (17.19m) and his Kerala team-mate Karthik Unnikrishnan (17.10m) had achieved that in the Indian Grand Prix in Bhubaneswar on May 21. Karthik finished fourth on Tuesday, managing a best effort of 16.47 while Eldhose Paul took bronze.

There was considerable attention on the women’s Long Jump competition after B Aishwarya (Karnataka) had caused a flutter in the qualifying round with a leap of 6.73m and broken the National Record for women’s Triple Jump 24 hours earlier. Despite fouling five tries, she marked 6.60m in her only legal jump to claim gold ahead of Kerala’s Ancy Sojan and L Sruthilekshmi. World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) was fourth with 6.26m.

Having tasted a rare defeat at the hands of Sarita Romit Singh in the Federation Cup in April this year, Manju Bala Singh (Rajasthan) returned to the Hammer Throw circle to assert her superiority with a 64.19m which was not only the best by an Indian woman this season and a new Meet Record but also passed the Commonwealth Games qualifying mark.

Amlan Borgohain (Assam) completed the men’s sprint double, winning the 200m in 21.00 seconds but his State-mate Hima Das was stopped in her attempt to emulate him. The host’s S Dhanalakshmi won in a photo-finish while Aishwarya Mishra (Maharashtra) took bronze, leaving Odisha’s Srabani Nanda (23.75) and Priya H Mohan (24.01) outside the medal bracket.

Vithya Ramraj (Tamil Nadu) came up with a personal best time of 57.08 seconds to win the women’s 400m Hurdles gold.  MP Jabir (Kerala) claimed top honours in the men’s 400m Hurdles in 49.76 seconds.

Aishwarya’s leap puts Tajinderpal Toor and Annu Rani’s efforts in the shade,"June 12, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 12: Karnataka Long Jumper B Aishwarya’s explosive effort in the qualifying round put solid efforts by Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani in the shade on the third day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

Aishwarya produced a stunning 6.73m leap in the women’s Long Jump qualifying round for a new Meet Record. Other familiar names like Ancy Sojan and Nayana James (both Kerala) and World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) also made it. to the final without fuss.

The 24-year-old Aishwarya’s effort pitchforked her to the second place on the Indian all-time list behind Anju Bobby George who set the National Record at 6.83m in the Athens Olympics in 2004 and backed it with a 6.75m effort to win the World Athletics Final in 2005. She took over the meet record from Mayookha Johny, who had pegged it at 6.63m in 2011.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s search for 20m puts ended on Sunday evening when he was able to send the iron ball past that mark three times. Despite registering no marks on two visits to the circle, the 27-year-old Olympian came up with three efforts over 20.14m, 20.29m and 20.34m to fine form and run out an easy winner.

Uttar Pradesh’s Annu Rani, India’s only woman Javelin thrower in the 60m club, had only two legal throws on Sunday but the second of those was over 60.93m. She has thrown the spear farther twice this season, but she will be happy that she has regained the consistency that she had embraced in the rup up to the Olympic Games last year.

There was a shock in store for Andhra Pradesh’s 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, who made waves with a series of good races overseas during which she took ownership of the National Record with a 13.04-second effort in the Netherlands. She did not find the rhythm, knocking a couple of hurdles down and tumbling on to the track after crashing into the final hurdle.

Tamil Nadu’s C Kanimozhi won the event in 13.62 seconds, becoming the second fastest Indian in the event this year. Jyothi Yarraji has the top six times and Kanimozhi improved her season’s best from 14.07 seconds to rise to the second spot behind the National Record holder and above the likes of Nandini Agasara (Telangana) and Aparna Roy (Kerala).

Karnataka quartermiler Priya H Mohan’s withdrawl from the women’s 400m final was expected to take the edge out, but Kiran Pahal (Haryana) and Rupal Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) provided excitement in a thrilling race.

Amlan Borgohain sets National mark; Sable Cracks 5000m Meet Record on Debut,"April 7, 2022","AFI Media

Kozhikode, April 6: Amlan Borgohain (Assam) scorched the track to set a new men’s 200m National Record by clocking 20.52 seconds on a rain-hit final day in the 25th AFI National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships in the C H Muhammed Koya Stadium here on Wednesday.

The 23-year-old sank Muhammed Anas Yahiya’s existing mark of 20.63 seconds in a race that saw the top three finish inside 21 seconds. However, it was only Amlan Borgohain who matched the Asian Games qualifying standard set by the Athletics Federation of India. Having run successive sub-21-second races in September and March, he gave proof of his progress.

Avinash Sable, known to break National records in the Steeplechase, rewrote the men’s 5000m meet record with a fine effort over 13:39.43 that raised expectation that he could soon be claiming the National record standing in the name of Bahadur Prasad since June 27, 1992. Kartik Kumar’s bid for the distance double came unstuck in the face of Sable’s run.

The top three finishers, including Uttar Pradesh’s Abhishek Pal met the Asian Games qualification criteria set by AFI. Running his maiden competitive race over the distance at the national level, Sable became the fourth fastest Indian in the 12-1/2-lap race. In fact, it was the fastest 5000m by an Indian on home soil.

The Triple Jump saw a pulsating contest with Eldhose Paul (Kerala) breaking a 10-year-old meet mark when he leapt 16.99m to claim gold. On a day when Praveen Chithravel (Tamil Nadu) and Karthik Unnikrishnan (Kerala) also secured qualification marks for the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, Eldhose Paul won by comfortable margin.

Two 31-year-old Hammer Throwers, Sarita Romit Singh (Uttar Pradesh) and Manju Bala Singh (Rajasthan) produced a riveting contest. Having traded the National Record over the last so many years, they fought tooth and nail on Wednesday. Manju Bala Singh led with 63.12m on her third try but Sarita Romit Singh won gold with 64.16m on her fifth attempt.

Manju Bala Singh also came up with a 64m throw on her last try but had to settle for silver. They pushed one another so competitively that it was the first time that both breached the 64m in the same competition. They also earned qualification marks for the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.

In the thrilling women’s 200m final, Hima Das (Assam) held back a challenge from Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra) and Priya H Mohan (Karnataka). Hima Das stopped the clock in 23.63 seconds to win by one-hundredth of a second from 400m champion Aishwarya. Priya H Mohan, who did not compete in the 400m, settled for third place in a personal best time.

There was a similar contest in the men’s 400m Hurdles final, MP Jabir (Kerala) and T Santhosh Kumar (Tamil Nadu) coming home inside 51 seconds while Dhaval Mahesh Utekar (Gujarat) beat the fancied Ayyasamy Dharun (Tamil Nadu) to the bronze medal.

Jeswin Aldrin steals National Record holder Sreeshankar’s thunder in Long Jump battle,"April 3, 2022","AFI Media 

Calicut, April 3: J Jeswin Aldrin (Tamil Nadu) came with a stunning wind-aided leap of 8.37m to beat Olympian S Sreeshankar (Kerala) in a fierce but friendly battle to grab the attention on the second day of the 25th AFI National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships in the C H Muhammed Koya Stadium here on Sunday.

On a day that saw nine jumps over 8m, Jeswin Aldrin produced a fine series that saw all five of his valid efforts past that mark while each of Sreeshankar sailed over that distance on each of his three valid tries, including an 8.36m that helped him improve his own National Record by 10cm and a place among the 10 best Asians ever in Long Jump.

Less than a month ago, the 20-year-old, who hails from Tiruchirapalli, broke into the select band of Indians in the 8m club when he won the Indian Grand Prix 2 in Thiruvananthapuram with 8.20m.

In a gripping contest, Sreeshankar opened with 8.16m and Jeswin Aldrin responded with 8.01. The younger jumper leapt 8.37m but a tail wind of 4.1m/s denied him the National and meet records. A fired up Sreeshankar could not stop Jeswin Aldrin from winning gold but came up with 8.36m on his third attempt to improve his own National and meet marks.

The exciting battle at the Long Jump pit helped Jeswin Aldrin and Sreeshankar steal the thunder from Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra) who had brought everyone to the edge of their seats with a sensational 400m sprint in 51.18 seconds, the fifth best time by an Indian woman and a meet record.

Scorching the track from the start, she appeared to run a race of her own. It became apparent by the halfway stage that she would by a big margin, leaving the others to battle for the second spot. Only Hima Das, three times in 2018, and Manjeet Kaur, once in 2004, have run quicker than Aishwarya Mishra.

These two performances meant that B Siva Kumar (Tamil Nadu) and Dutee Chand (Odisha), who claimed the titlesof the fastest man and woman respectively, had to settle for less of the limelight on Sunday.

The 27-year-old Siva Kumar, who clocked a personal best time of 10.37 seconds, was identified as the winner only after the photo finish equipment gave him an edge of four-thousandths of a second over Tamil Nadu team-mate Elakkiadasan.  Dutee Chand returned to winning ways after suffering defeats in the Federation Cup and National Inter-State Championships last year.

Sourabh Rathi, a 21-year-old from Uttar Pradesh, marked his debut in the senior ranks with a Decathlon gold. With a determined effort in the 1500m, the final of the 10 events, he leapfrogged past the leaders Boota Singh and Mohit. Boota Singh looked set to add a fourth National-level crown but was a slow 1500m meant he finished 24 points behind Sourabh Rathi.

There were good victories for Ajay Kumar Saroj (Uttar Pradesh) and Lili Das (West Bengal) in the men and women’s 1500m races, both having to showcase their ability to produce a kick to outsprint Rahul (Delhi) and Ankita Dhyani (Uttarakhand) respectively.

Earlier in the day, Andhra Pradesh’s Jyothi Yarraji clocked 13.43 seconds to top her 100m Hurdles heats in a new meet record time, improving on Anuradha Biswal’s 13.48 seconds effort in New Delhi 16 years ago.

"Shaili Singh bags Long Jump silver, India enjoys best show in WAU20 Championships","August 22, 2021","AFI Media

Nairobi, August 22: Shaili Singh claimed the women’s Long Jump silver medal in the World Athletics U20 Championships here on Sunday. Her slight wind-aided effort of 6.59m was only 1cm short of the gold medal jump by Sweden’s Maja Askag but her silver medal ensured that Indian athletics continues to showcase the progress it has been making.

Until this edition, India had won a total of four medals in the World Athletics Junior Championships, with bronze medals for Discus Thrower Seema Antil (2002) and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon (2014) and gold medals for Javelin Thrower Neeraj Chopra (2016) and 400m runner Hima Das (2018). India has nearly matched that tally here.

Shaili Singh’s was India’s third medal in the World Athletics U20 Championships here, coming after the bronze won by the Mixed Team in the 4x400m Relay and the silver by Amit Khatri in the men’s 10,000m Race Walk. India finished 21st on the medal table, aware that a gold would have lifted it to the top 15.

Having started with two jumps of 6.34m, Shaili Singh shot into the lead after three rounds when she leapt to 6.59m, with the aid of a slight tail wind. But Sweden’s Maja Askag stole that position with her fourth jump that measured just 1cm more. The Indian tried hard but fouled two attempts and then had a 6.37m on her final try to regain pole position.

Earlier, Donald Makirmairaj was in bronze medal position when he logged in 15.70m on his second try but was soon crowded out of the podium reckoning. He fought back with a personal best leap of 15.82m on his fifth attempt, 6cm more than his previous best. Jumping into a slight headwind, he finished just 3cm short of Frenchman Simon Gore’s bronze medal winning effort.

Gallant efforts by Summy and Priya Habbanathahalli Mohan in the second and anchor legs lifted the Indian women’s 4x400m relay squad from fifth place to a creditable fourth in a time of 3:40.45. They both had sub-54 second split times, being credited with 53.75 and 53.38, and tried to balance the efforts of Payal Vohra (57.28) and Rajitha Kunja (56.04).

Ankita Dhyani finished sixth in the gruelling women’s 5000m in a time of 17:17.68, as she bravely took the challenge presented to distance runners by the altitude of Nairobi. She stuck with the leaders – the only non-African in the bunch of six – till the 3000m mark.

Ankita finished in the top six after the disqualification of Melknat Wudu (Ethiopia) and Prisc Chesang (Uganda) who broke the beam in the second and third places but had stepped inside the track with about 1300m left.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shailiarticle.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/shaili-singh-bags-long-jump-silver-india-enjoys-best-show-in-wau20-championships/,Athletics
Mixed Relay squad claims bronze medal in World Athletics U20 Championships,"August 18, 2021","AFI Media

Nairobi, August 18: The Indian 4x400m mixed relay team claimed the bronze medal on the opening day of World Athletics U20 Championships here today. Barath Sridhar, Priya Mohan, Summy and Kapil clocked 3:20.60 behind Nigeria (3:19.70) and Poland (3:19.80) to post a creditable time and gave a glimpse of the depth of India’s talent in the quartermile event.

The Indian quartet – with Abdul Razak Rasheed running the lead leg – had clocked 3:23.36 in the heats in the morning. Priya and Summy ran their women’s 400m heats not long after that. They recovered well to ensure that the efforts of Barath and Kapil, who ran a blistering anchor leg in 46.42 seconds, did not go in vain.

Barath, the Federation Cup Junior Championships winner, was credited with a time of 47.12 for the lead-off leg and handed over the baton to Priya in the second place behind South Africa. Priya dug deep in her reserves and, with a time of 52.77, was the third best among those who ran the second leg. Summy’s kept India in the medal hunt and she ran a good leg in 54.29.

Kapil strove hard on the anchor leg but despite being the fastest of the runners in the final was unable to close the gap with Poland and Nigeria. He was credited with having run his lap in 46.42 seconds, inspired by the efforts of his three team-mates.

It is the fifth medal won by India in World Junior Championships after the bronze medals won by Seema Antil (Discus Throw, 2002), Navdeep Kaur Dhillon (Discus Throw 2014) and the gold medals claimed by Neeraj Chopra (Javelin Throw, 2016) and Hima Das (400m 2018).

It was a good day for India as Priya Mohan (women’s 400m), Amandeep Singh Dhaliwal (men’s Shot Put) and Kunwar Ajai Raj Singh Rana and Jay Kumar (both men’s Javelin Throw) qualified for their respective finals.

Priya finished third in her heats in 53.79 seconds but qualified as one of the two best finishers alongside Ukraine’s Tetyana Kharashchuk. Summy finished fifth in her heats in 55.43 seconds Amandeep Singh Dhaliwal made it to the Shot Put final with a best throw of 17.92m while Kunwer Ajai Raj Singh Rana (71.05m) and Jay Kumar (70.34m) earned berths in the Javelin Throw final to be held on August 20.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mixed-relay-world-athletics-bronze.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/mixed-relay-squad-claims-bronze-medal-in-world-athletics-u20-championships/,Athletics

"Seema Antil breaks two-decade-old record, books berth in Tokyo2020 with 63.72m throw","June 29, 2021","Patiala, June 29: Seema Antil (Uttar Pradesh) qualified for the discus throw competition in the Olympic Games in Tokyo with a 63.72m throw on the final day of the Fast&Up 60th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Tuesday. She became the 12th individual Indian athlete to qualify for Tokyo2020.

Having reached Patiala from Belarus in the wee hours of June 27, the 37-year-old went past the 60m mark on four of her five legal throws, going close to the Olympic Qualifying mark of 63.50m with her third effort of 63.18m that was a new meet record before finding the power to breach the Olympic standard with her fourth try.

Without a world ranking since she was nursing a glutes injury, Seema Antil was taking part in only her third competition since the 2018 Asian Games. She threw 62.64m in ṭhe Federation Cup here in March and after managing 58.62 in Minsk on June 25, she secured her ticket to the fourth Olympic Games with her first throws over 63m since August 7, 2004 in Kiev.

“I know I can throw farther with my training but I was wary of aggravating the issue with my glutes muscles. I have worked hard over the last two and half years since the Asian Games and am happy that I could secure qualification today. I will consult the Athletics Federation of India and draw up my training programme for the Olympic Games,” she said.

Besides the 4x400m mixed relay squad,  Avinash Sable (men’s 3000m Steeplechase), Tajinderpal Singh Toor (men’s Shot Put), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (men’s Javelin Throw), M Sreeshankar (men’s Long Jump), Kamalpreet Kaur (women’s Discus Throw) and race walkers KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (men) and Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (women) have already qualified for the Olympic Games.

There is expectation that some others like MP Jabir (men’s 400m Hurdles), Dutee Chand (women’s 200m), Annu Rani (women’s Javelin Throw) will make it on the strength of their world ranking. Besides if the men and women’s relay teams, ranked 13 and 16 on the Road to Olympic Games list at the time of writing, may raise the size of the Indian athletics team.

With World Athletics responding positively to the Athletics Federation of India request to consider the 3:01.89 clocked in the 4x400m heats on Friday, the men’s team was restored to the 13th place ahead of Germany, Poland and Czech Republic. It let the men’s team to rest Amoj Jacob and run a relaxed race today.

Running with a changed combination after Hima Das pulled out, the Indian women’s 4x100m relay squad of AK Daneshwari, Archana Suseendran, S Dhanalakshmi and Dutee Chand had to content itself with a new meet record time of 44.15 seconds, short of its target (43.03 seconds) that would have earned it a berth in the Olympic Games.

Hima Das tried gamely to compete in the women’s 200m final, chasing 22.80 seconds to qualify, but finished fifth in 25.03 seconds. PD Anjali (Kerala) and Lovepreet Singh (Punjab) were the winners of the women’s and men’s 200m sprints in 24.01 seconds and 21.04 seconds respectively.

S Dhanalakshmi (Tamil Nadu) confirmed his growing stature as India’s premier woman sprinter by handing Dutee Chand another defeat in the final.

The 20-year-old Gurindervir Singh, who has held sway in the sprints in the recent times, was quickly off the blocks, found the pace and the momentum to leave his team-mate Lovepreet Singh and the National Record holder Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha ) fighting for the lesser medals.

With Hima Das pulling up injured after finishing third in heats in the morning, the women’s race was expected to be a clash featuring Dhanalakshmi and her more experienced team-mates Dutee Chand and Archana Suseendran as well as Sri Lanka’s Amasha de Silva. Dhanalakshmi powered away to a good victory in 11.52 seconds.

The sprinters shared the limelight with the rising long jumper Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh). Preparing for the World Junior Athletics Championships, to be held in Kenya in August, she leapt to a career best distance of 6.48m in the Punjabi University facility to be among the world’s top ranked junior jumpers this year.

At the same venue, National Record holder Tejaswin Shankar cleared 2.20m effortlessly to win the men’s High Jump. He made a game attempt to get the meet record by raising the bar to 2.26m after two unsuccessful jumps at 2.23m. He achieved his primary aim of raking up some points to move up the World Athletics Ranking with a win here.

Uttar Pradesh’s 19-year-old Usaid Khan won the gruelling decathlon competition with an all-round effort that fetched him 6893 points.

Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv and Noah Nirmal Tom took the track with the singular aim of improving its time from 3:02.61 in the Indian Grand Prix 4 here on Monday. It could heave a sigh of relief after the squad attained that goal with a determined effort against the clock.

An Indian team had clocked 3:02.59 in Turkey on July 25, 2019, but that time had left it in the 16th place. With the Olympic qualification window closing on June 29, the squad had to come up with its fastest effort since July 10, 2016 when Kunju Muhammed, Muhammad Anas, Ayyasamy Dhrun and Arokia Rajiv clocked 3:00.91 in Bengaluru – the best by an Indian team.

The women’s 4x100m quartet of Archana Suseendran, Hima Das, S Dhanalakshmi and Dutee Chand, chasing the magical mark of 43.05 seconds to attain qualification for the Olympic Games, was 0.45 seconds short in the heats on Friday. The team, which set a New National Record of 43.47 seconds in the Indian Grand Prix 4 on Monday, was credited with a time faster than the meet record (45.69) standing in the name of Tamil Nadu.

C Kanimozhi, who clocked a personal best of 13.63 in the 100m Hurdles in the Federation Cup here on March 15 this year, held off a challenge by Agasara Nandini. The Telangana girl improved on her own career best from 13.88 to 13.70. Sri Lanka’s WVL Sugandi had to settle for the third place behind the two Indians who have battled for the 100m hurdles prize this year.

Madhya Pradesh’s Vikram Bharatsingh Bangriya won the gruelling men’s 10000m race from Kartik Kumar (Uttar Pradesh) while Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) dominated the women’s 5000m event, winning comfortably from Maharashtra’s Komal Chandrakant Jadgalde and Ankita Dhyani (Uttarakhand).

Returning to competition after nearly two years, Manju Bala (Rajasthan) claimed the Hammer Throw gold with a 61.08m effort on her fifth try at the Punjabi University ground. As many as five of her throws were better than the second-placed Sarita R Singh (Uttar Pradesh) whose best was a 56.13 on a day when she registered three no marks.

Patiala, June 24: There is more than the usual excitement that accompanies any national-level athletics meet on the eve of the five-day Fast & Up National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here from Friday. It is the last chance for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games and a high level of competition is expected.

Graded as B category event for the World Athletics ranking, it offers more than a few athletes the chance to make it to the Tokyo Olympic Games. For the athletes who can make it to the Games on the strength of their rankings, this is an opportunity to consolidate their rankings and secure a berth in Tokyo2020.

A bunch of Sri Lankans are also lining up to use the last chance saloon to earn themselves a place in the Games. Nadeesha Ramanayake (women’s 400m) and Nimali Waliwarsha (women’s 800m) are among the prominent names from the Island nation. Nadeesha is 59th and Nimali 57th in their respective events in the Road to Olympic Games rankings

It is the 10th national-level event that the AFI is conducting this year, including two for juniors, a race-walking championship, a cross-country championship, four Grand Prix meets and the Federation Cup. AFI has worked hard, with support from the Sports Authority of India, to offer the athletes the maximum chances to qualify for Tokyo2020 and improve their ranking.

Kamalpreet Kaur (women’s discus throw) and men’s shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor made the most of the opportunities in the last two meets to book their tickets to Tokyo. Others like Dutee Chand (women’s 100m), Hima Das (women’s 200m) and Harmilan Bains (women’s 1500m) went within hailing distance of the respective qualifying marks on Monday.

Besides, the spotlight in the Fast&Up National Inter-State Championships will be on the women’s 4x100m relay team and the men’s 4x400m relay squad.

The quartet of Dutee Chand, Hima Das, Archana Suseendran and S Dhanalakshmi will look to break the National Record for the second time in a week and aim for a 43.05-second effort to be among the 16 teams in Tokyo. The team clocked 43.37 seconds in the Indian Grand Prix 4 on Monday to be ranked 20th in the world.

Similarly, the men’s 1600m relay squad of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv and Noah Nirmal Tom will aim to improve its time from 3:02.61 on Monday to 3:02.56 or even 3:02.50 to lift itself from the present ranking of 16 and ensure that it can spend the next few weeks preparing for the Games.

Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor qualifies for Tokyo2020;Four National marks set,"June 21, 2021","Patiala, June 21: Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) qualified for the Tokyo Olympic Games with a hefty 21.49m effort while sprinter Dutee Chand, discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur and the India 4x400m relay team also set new National Records in the Indian Grand Prix 4 athletics meet at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports on Monday.

The 26-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor, whose previous best was 20.92m, became the 11th individual Indian track and field athlete to qualify for Tokyo2020 by going past the qualifying mark of 21.10m with each of his four legal puts. He sealed the berth with his opening try and had other puts of 21.28, 21.13 and 21.13 besides no marks with his second and sixth attempts.

“It is a relief to be competing and I am grateful to the Athletics Federation of India for organising so many meets at home to give us chances to qualify for the Olympics,” Tajinderpal Singh Toor said. “I was throwing around 22m last year but Corona troubled the world. I had to get my body back in line, but when I did that, competitions were cancelled. I am glad that I could be at my best today. I was aiming for 21.50m and I got that with my first try.”

Dutee Chand mounted a gallant effort to crack the Olympic qualifying standard of 11.15 seconds in the women’s 100m. While she rewrote her own National Record, she was a heart-breaking two-hundredths of a second away from the magic mark. She also anchored the Indian team to a victory in the 4x100m relay in 43.37 seconds.

Kamalpreet Kaur also said she wanted to show her gratitude for the opportunity to compete with a good series as the sole competitor in the women’s Discus Throw event. Aiming for a 69m effort on Monday, she started with 63.41m throw before two fouls. She followed those with a 62.33m throw and uncorked her new National Record throw of 66.69m.

There were also game efforts by Hima Das (Assam) in the women’s 200m and Harmilan Kaur Bains (Punjab) in the women’s 1500m to take a crack at the Olympic qualifying marks but both fell short by small margins. Hima Das won the sprint in 22.88 seconds, a mere 0.08 seconds off the qualifying mark while Harmilan Bains, chasing 4:04.20, won the metric mile in 4:08.27.

"Outrun by covid driven travel ban, India relay team stranded at home","April 28, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, April 28: Indian women’s 4x100m and men’s 4x400m relay teams are left stranded at home as the new Covid-19 driven travel bans are put in place by various countries. The Indian squad will be missing from the action at the World Athletics Relays Silesia 21 on May 1 and 2 at Chorzow in Poland after the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) that was to fly the runners intimated that it would be unable to let them board the flight from Mumbai in the wake of the Netherlands government ban on passenger flights from India.

India was set to field the men’s 4x400m and women’s 4x100m relay squads in the World Athletics Relays Silesia 21.

Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President said, “We are very disappointed at this moment. There are no direct flights between Indian airports and Warsaw, Poland. This meant that despite the best efforts, the squad could not be rerouted on another airline,”

“For the last 24-hours we have been consistently trying to find alternatives, we have used all the resources to sort this out, we have been constantly speaking to the Organisers, the World Athletics, various consulates and airlines to reroute them. Under the present scenario nobody has obliged,”

The women’s 4x100m team includes India’s top sprinters such as Hima Das, Dutee Chand, Dhanalaxmi Sekhar, Archana Suseentran, Daneshwari TA and Himashree Roy while men’s 4x400m squad is comprised of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Arokia Rajeev, Amoj Jacob, Nirmal Noah Tom and Sarthak Bhambri.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AFI-travel-ban-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/outrun-by-covid-driven-travel-ban-india-relay-team-stranded-at-home/,Athletics
AFI names 20-member squad for next month’s World Athletics Relays in Poland,"April 6, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, April 6: Athletics Federation of India has on Tuesday named a 20-member squad of athletes, including seven women 100m runners, to compete in the World Athletics Relays Silesia21 in the Silesian Stadium in Chorzow, Poland, on May 1 and 2. It will be the first major international event for the sprinters since the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha in April 2019.

“We are excited to get our athletes ready for their first international competition after the Covid-induced gap. We are glad the team will spend time in training in Turkey before it reaches Chorzow of the World Athletics Relays,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said.

“We were able to organise meets in NIS Patiala in February and March so that our athletes had a feel of competition.”

The AFI President said the coaching staff was confident that the athletes would be ready to deliver their best performance. “The Federation has done everything in its power to enable the athletes stay healthy and train through the lockdown and beyond and be ready for international competition,” he said.

Mr. Sumariwalla said AFI was happy that its focus on women’s 100m sprinters in National camps has paid off. “With S Dhanalakshmi emerging on the scene in the Federation Cup last month, she and Dutee Chand are two Indian runners who have run sub-11.50 times this season. We believe the 4x100m women’s team with Dhanalakshmi, Dutee, Hima Das and Archana Suseendran can come up with a good effort,” he said.

Meanwhile, Olympic bound javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh along with Rohit Yadav, Rajender Singh and Annu Rani are also being cleared by AFI for a training camp in Turkey later this month.

The team:

Men’s 4x400m relay: Amoj Jacob, Naganathan Pandi, Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Arokia Rajiv, Sarthak Bhambri, Ayyasamy Dharun and Nirmal Noah Tom.

Women’s 4x400m relay: MR Poovamma, Subha Venkatesh, Kiran, Anjali Devi, R Revathi, VK Vismaya and Jisna Mathew.

Discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur uncorks National Record throw to secure Olympic berth,"March 19, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 19: Kamalpreet Kaur’s one legal throw in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships on Friday rewrote the women’s Discus Throw National Record and claimed her a spot in the Olympic Games competition to be held in Tokyo later this year. Her 65.06m opening effort did the trick for her, producing the fourth National Record in five days.

With a sustained burst of speed, Hima Das (Assam) with a time of 23.21 seconds left S Dhanalakhsmi (23.39s) and Archana Suseendran (23.60s) fighting for the silver medal in the high-profile women’s 200m final. K Elakkiadasan claimed the mens 200m while Ayyasamy Dharun and R Vithya Ramraj won the men and women’s 400m Hurdles to ease Tamil Nadu contingent’s pain somewhat.

On a day when the men’s Triple Jump competition saw an intense battle, with Karthik Unnikrishnan producing a last-ditch 16.73m and Abdulla managing a 16.59 on his last try to push their Kerala team-mate Eldhose Paul to the third place with a best 16.53m that he had got on his second jump, it was Kamalpreet Kaur’s solitary throw that stole the limelight.

The 25-year-old from Badal in Punjab was not overawed by the presence of the 2014 Asian Games champion Seema Punia. Nor did Kamalpreet Kaur did not let the fact that she had a couple of 60m-plus behind her affect her. The earlier such throws came in the 2018 Inter-Railway Championships in Lucknow (61.04m) and the 2019 Federation Cup here (60.25m).

With Seema Punia coming up a no mark on her opening throw, Kamalpreet could enter the fray without training on her mind on a target distance but only focused on giving her best. She wound herself up well and unleashed the biggest throw by an Indian woman, surpassing the National record that has stood at 64.76m in the name of Krishan Poonia since 2012.

Seema Punia, who has won a medal in each of her four Commonwealth Games appearances and has two Asian Games medals, fought hard to mark her return to competition after the 2018 Asian Games with a victory. She came up with four throws in excess of 60.50m but her best was the 62.64m that she managed on her fifth attempt.

Kamalpreet this became the 10th Indian to secure the Tokyo Olympic Games athletics qualification mark laid down by World Athletics. Of course, the Mixed team in the 4x400m relay has also secured a berth in the Tokyo Games. Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Dutee Chand (100m) and Annu Rani (Javelin Throw) can get into the Olympic competition by virtue of their World ranking.

Those who had booked their Olympic tickets earlier include Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (20km Race Walk), M Sreeshankar (Long Jump), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (Javelin Throw) among the men, Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (20km Race Walk) among women.

Dhanalakshmi breaks Usha’s meet record and eyes sprint double in Federation Cup,"March 18, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 18: S Dhanalakshmi (Tamil Nadu), who stunned Dutee Chand in the 100m final on Tuesday, emerged as the sprinter to beat in the women’s 200m, clocking a Meet Record time of 23.26 seconds in the women’s 200m semifinals in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports on Thursday.

Her victory over Hima Das (Assam) who clocked 24.39 seconds in the semifinal heats lifted her to the top 10 of Indian all-time list. Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) won her semifinal heats in 24.07 seconds to raise expectations of a good final. It must be stated that both Hima Das (23.10) and Archana Suseendran (23.18) have faster times than the one blazed by Dhanalakshmi on Thursday.

Her time broke PT Usha’s long-standing meet record of 23.30 seconds set in Chennai in 1998. Having run 24.05 seconds when finishing third in the Federation Cup here two years ago, she recorded a 23.47 in the Tamil Nadu State Championships in Sivakasi on January 24, thus making it the second time she was dipping in under 23.50 seconds.

Returning to competition after a long break, Swapna Barman won the Heptathlon with a total of 5636 points, her 1.82m High Jump making up for the 2:29.98 in the 800m. Mareena George (Kerala) finished second, a poor shot put performance denying her a shot at beating the 2018 Asian Games champion in the gruelling seven-event challenge.

The front-running Krishan Kumar (Haryana) beat back a stiff challenge over the last 100m by Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) in the men’s 800m. Those trailing Krishan Kumar at the bell may have been expected him to slow down but he chugged on. Ankesh Chaudhary stepped up the pace and even held the lead for a brief while on the home straight but he could not power on.

Delhi’s Chanda won the women’s 800m in a personal best time of 2 minutes 2.57 seconds. It was the fastest time clocked by an Indian woman since Tintu Luka’s 2:00.58 in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on August 17, 2016. It was a brave start-to-finish effort by Chanda, but she finished outside the Olympic Games qualification mark set at 1:59.50.

Lili Das (Bengal) moved up from sixth place with 150m left and timed her shift to the outside lane to a nicety to be able to slip past MR Poovamma (Karnataka) with only a few strides left for the finish. It was Lili Das’ personal best time, too, the 2:02.98 improving on the 2:03.46 that she clocked in Guntur in July 2017. Poovamma (2:03.35) also earned her personal best.

In fact, with Rachna (Haryana), Shalu Chaudhary (Delhi) and Aishwarya Mishra (Maharashtra) also clocking their best times, the women’s half-mile saw the top six runners attain new peaks respectively.

Talking of personal bests, Gracena Glistus Mery (Tamil Nadu) attained one with a 1.84m effort to win the women’s High Jump. The 20-year-old cleared that height on her second attempt after having needed three tries to cross the bar when it was placed at 1.81m. Her previous best of 1.79m was achieved in the University trials in Bhubaneshwar on March 8.

The last time an Indian woman jumped higher than Gracena Mery’s 1.84m was back on June 3, 2017 when heptathlete Swapna Barman cleared 1.87m. The girl from Kanyakumari thus becomes the latest Indian high jumper to join the 1.80m club. Her clearance drew gasps since it was the height that was good for bronze medal in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018.

The results (finals):

800m: 1. Krishan Kumar (Haryana) 1:48.48; 2. Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) 1:48.65; 3. Annu Kumar (Uttarakhand) 1:49.25.

Sreeshankar’s National Record leap pitchforks him to Olympic Games in Tokyo,"March 16, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 16: Long Jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) gave himself a double bonanza as an early birthday present – booking his place in the Olympic Games competition with a National Record leap of 8.26m in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships 2021 at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex here on Tuesday.

On a day when Tamil Nadu’s S Dhanalakshmi handed Dutee Chand (Odisha) a rare defeat in a national competition as she blazed the track to win the women’s 100m sprint in a stunning time of 11.39 seconds and Amoj Jacob (Delhi) secured a personal best in winning the men’s 400m, it was Sreeshankar’s National Record that stole the thunder.

Sreeshankar found the perfect combination of acceleration, take off and elevation on his fifth attempt to realise his dream of securing an automatic entry in the Olympic Games by breaching the entry standard of 8.22m. The World No. 24 improved on his own National mark of 8.20m, set in Bhubaneshwar on September 27, 2018.

Getting off the pit, he sensed that he had attained his goal, holding his arms aloft as he watched the officials measure the distance. His joy knew no bounds when he got the confirmation on the electronic board. On each of his four previous attempts, he had breached the 8.00m mark with a string that read 8.02, 8.04, 8.07 and 8.09. He found the explosive combination on the fifth try.

“I am thankful to everyone who supported me to achieve this result. I wanted to prove a point as everyone thought 8.20 was my peak and after that my performance was not the same. I am really very happy,” said Sreeshankar.

Delhi’s 23-year-old Amoj Jacob showed a fine turn of speed to combine with staying power to claim the men’s quarter-mile crown with a career best time of 45.68 against more experienced runners. On the contrary, M R Poovamma’s resilience and determination in the women’s 400m proved too good against a bunch of youngsters, each eager to make an impression.

Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) dominated the men’s 100m dash, winning in 10.32 seconds, showing that the personal best of 10.30 seconds achieved in the semifinals was not a flash in the pan. He was a picture of confidence and power as he led from gun to beam, leaving K Elakkiadasan (Tamil Nadu) and Krishnakumar Satish Rane (Maharashtra) to fight for the second spot.

In the women’s 100m final, the 22-year-old Dhanalakshmi scripted a start-to-finish win, riding on an explosive start that placed her in the lead very early in the blue riband race. If there were any signs of nerves when she was up against the likes of Dutee Chand, Hima Das and Archana Suseendran, Dhanalakshmi did not let anyone see that, powering her way to a famous victory.

Dhanalakshmi produced only her second best time, a hundredths of a second slower than the 11.38 seconds she had clocked in the semifinal heats on Monday. Dutee Chand tried hard to catch up but the girl from Tiruchirapalli showed no signs of slowing down as she broke the beam 0.19 seconds before the Asian Games medallist and World Universities Games champion.

Those who scurried to the record books discovered that the last time Dutee Chand did not win a race featuring only Indians was back in the Inter-Railway Championship in Bhopal in August 2015, a month after she ended up with bronze in the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Chennai.

Late in the day, Harmilan Kaur Bains (Punjab) spreadeagled the women’s 1500m field that included PU Chitra (Kerala) and Lili Das (West Bengal) with a personal best time of 4:08.70. She set a hot pace from the start and only Chitra tried to catch up in the first lap and a half, only to realise that Harmilan Kaur Bains was in a league of her own.

It was the second fastest time for a metric mile by an Indian woman, the National Record of 4:06.03 having been set by Sunita Rani in the Busan Asian Games back in October 2002. The 22-year-old Harmilan Kaur Bains is daughter of former middle-distance runners Amandeep Bains and Madhuri Singh, who won the 800m silver in the Busan Asian Games.

Javelin Thrower Annu Rani rewrites National Record to give Federation Cup great start,"March 15, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 15: Javelin Thrower Annu Rani’s single-minded determination to produce a throw in excess of the Olympic qualification standard of 64.00m led her to rewriting her own National Record with a 63.24m effort on the opening day of the 24th Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex here on Monday.

The 27-year-old World No. 12 came up with a standout performance, with three throws beyond 61m, and she led Uttar Pradesh to a three-gold show in four finals. The ball was set rolling by Savita Pal, 21, who made her debut in a 10000m race a memorable one by sprinting past Sanjvani Jadhav (Maharashtra). Shot putter Kiran Baliyan accounted for Uttar Pradesh’s third gold with a 16.45m effort.

The consistent Annu Rani did not belie expectations on Monday. She opened with a throw of 61.45m and backed it up with another over 61.03m. Having warmed up to the task, she then uncorked a throw over 63.24m that was an improvement of 81 centimeters on the National Record that she set in the World Athletics Championships in Doha in 2019.

Muhammad Anas Yahiya (Kerala) showed his form by topping the men’s 400m qualification for the final with a 46.26-second run. His pace helped Haryana’s Ayush Dabas make it to the final as one of the two fastest non-automatic qualifiers. Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) was another who won his semifinal heats in 46.84 and enabled Jashanjot Singh to make the final grace.

Earlier, Amoj Jacob cantered to stop the clock in his heats in 47.80 seconds. With P Naganathan also clocking a sub-47, the men’s 400m final promises quite some fireworks. There is no doubt that each of the eight finalists will put his best foot forward in what can become the most talked about men’s final on Tuesday.

The seasoned MR Poovamma led the eight qualifiers into the women’s 400m final, powering to victory in 54.34 seconds, the second fastest time this season. Eager to show that she is India’s premier quarter-miler, the 29-year-old ran a fine race in the opening heats, winning by over 2-1/2 seconds.

Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra), who won the second of the three semifinal heats, dipped home in 55.05 seconds. The Haryana trio of 20-year-old Kiran Pahal, 18-year-old Deepanshi and Nancy, 21, and Tamil Nadu’s Subha Venkatesan, also 21, all came home inside 56.15 seconds to raise visions of a bright future for the women’s 400m.

Tamil Nadu’s S Dhanalakshmi warmed the hearts of sprint fans with a fine race in the women’s 100m semifinals. She threw down the gauntlet for Dutee Chand (Odisha) with a 11.38-second 100m sprint that stunned viewers just as much as it would have her State-mate Archana Suseendran, who was second in that heat in 11.66 seconds.

Taking to the track after Assam’s Hima Das won her heats in 11.63 seconds, Dutee Chand clocked 11.51 without straining every sinew. Featuring the three sprinters, there is no doubt that the final will spark excitement and great expectations of being a spectacle.

In the afternoon, Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) set a personal best time of 10.30 seconds in the men’s 100m semifinals. It was the third fastest time by an Indian sprinter behind the 10.21 clocked by Anil Kumar in the year 2000) and the 10.26 clocked by Amiya Kumar Mallick (2016) and Sanjeet Singh (2018). It equaled the 10.30 by Mohammed Abdul Najeeb Qureshi (2010).

Exploding to a good start, he blazed the track to leave the field gaping in awe. Telangana’s Amlan Borgohain was the second fastest qualifier, winning his semifinal heats in 10.44 seconds. Harjit Singh (Punjab) was the only other sprinter to dip in under 10.50 seconds when he won his semifinal heats in 10.48.

Neeraj Chopra overcomes windy conditions to break own National Record,"March 5, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 5: Neeraj Chopra warmed the hearts of Indian athletics fans with a National Record throw of 88.07m on his return to competitive fray after more than a year in the Indian Grand Prix III at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Friday. His best throw was a centimeter better than the record he set in the Asian Games in Jakarta on August 27, 2018.

Each of his four legal throws were better than the 81.63m that Shivpal Singh (Uttar Pradesh) managed with his fifth attempt on a day when the wind added to the challenge of the throwers. Neeraj Chopra, the 23-year-old from Haryana and possibly the first athlete to switch his mobile phone off in the run up to the Olympic Games, dealt with that challenge the best.

“There was a strong wind today and I have little experience of throwing in such windy conditions. My favourite Javelin was gaining much elevation in the wind. I then used another Javelin and focused on getting a good release. I didn’t feel I used much power with the fifth throw that went past the record,” he said.

“It feels good to be competing again after a long spell for the second time, first because of my injury and then because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I am hopeful of giving off my best in all competitions and doing well for the country in the Olympic Games in Tokyo,” he said, well aware of the tough competition he will face. “I will do the best to take Indian athletics to new heights.”

There were other quality performances that drew the attention of the critics and fans. Amoj Jacob improved upon his personal best in the 400m yet again by stopping the clock at 45.70 seconds, a good three-tenths of a second faster than the time he had clocked in Indian Grand Prix II here last week.

Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor breached the 20m mark and Long Jumper M Sreeshankar showed consistency by hitting sand at 7.91m after having past 8m last week. In the 200m sprint, Muhammed Anas Yahiya clocked 21.48 seconds to sustain his speed work as part of his preparations for the 400m while Steeplechaser Avinash Sable showed good form to clock 8:24.40.

In the women’s events, Javelin Thrower Annu Rani tryst with throws in excess of 60m continued as she produced a best of 61.98m on Friday. She had another effort of 61.96m while four other throws were below the 60m mark. And, there was 400m-800m double for M R Poovamma while Hima Das, running alone, clocked a personal best time of 11.67 seconds in the 100m.

Amoj Jacob produces personal best 400m time to delight athletics fans,"February 25, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, February 25: Amoj Jacob (Delhi) came up with a personal best time of 46.00 seconds to win the men’s 400m in the Indian Grand Prix II at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Thursday. In improving on the 46.26 he clocked in June 2017, he showed a smart recovery from the injury that forced him to hobble out of the race in Grand Prix I last week.

Two of his relay squad team-mates, Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) and Muhammed Anas Yahiya (Kerala), were locked in a fascinating contest over the 200m sprint – part of their overall preparations. Arokia Rajiv defeated Anas, who holds the National Record, by 0.20 seconds, with a time of 21.24 seconds.

Kerala’s M Sreeshankar, competing in his first national-level Long Jump competition since October 2019, produced a best leap of 8.05m on his sixth try. He would have been pleased with his rhythm that fetched him jumps between 7.75m and 7.87m and egged by that, he went over the 8m mark to have a promising start to the season.

In the men’s Shot Put, Tajinderpal Singh’s opening effort of 19.49m was good for gold but he would have expected to throw farther in his subsequent tries. Each of his two foul throws was followed by 19.31m and 19.33m while the 18.95m put on his fourth try would have disappointed him the most.

Javelin Thrower Annu Rani (Uttar Pradesh), seeking Olympic qualifying mark of 64.00m, wound herself up and delivered a 61.22m throw with her opening effort. She followed that up with two throws over the 60m mark. She will draw much confidence from her showing here and will look to qualify for to the Tokyo Olympics rather than bank on her ranking as World No. 12.

Sprinter Dutee Chand blazed the track to win the women;s 100m in 11.44 seconds, an improvement on the 11.51 seconds she clocked last week. She is hoping to qualify for the Olympic Games by meeting the 11.15 seconds standard but will also keep an eye on conforming a place among the 56 starters in Tokyo on the basis of her ranking as World No. 33 at the moment.

In the 200m, Hima Das (Assam) made light of the absence of much competition to win in 23.31 seconds. She has run faster only three times, twice in 2018 when she had times of 23.10 In the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Guwahati and 23.22 in Gliwic Grand Prix in Poland and once in 2019 when she clocked 23.25 in Velká cena Tábora in Tabor, Czech Republic.

Indian Mixed Relay squad given Asian Games Gold,"July 23, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, July 23: The Indian 4×400 mixed relay quartet of Mohammed Anas, MR Poovamma, Hima Das and Arokia Rajiv in the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta has been upgraded to gold medal position. Besides, Anu Raghavan moved from fourth place to bronze medal position in the women’s 400m hurdles.

The Bahrain squad, which finished first in the 4×400 mixed relay final, was disqualified with Kemi Adekoya of Bahrain being handed a four-year ban by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) for failing a dope test.

Athletics Federation of India President Adille J. Sumariwalla said AFI is delighted to see the World Athletics website ranking India’s 4x400m mixed relay squad as the winner of the Asian Games and Anu Raghavan as the bronze medal winner of the women’s 400m hurdles. “The additional medal takes our tally to 20, including eight gold and nine silver,” he said.

“The news comes as a fillip to us as we are aiming to build on the Asian Games showing and make a mark at the global level in the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year,” he said. “The 4x400m relay squad will be particularly pleased that it now has two gold and a silver from Jakarta. We are confident that under coach Galina Bukharina’s guidance, the relay squad will perform well.”

The 4x400m mixed relay team of Mohammed Anas, MR Poovamma, Hima Das and Arokia Rajiv had finished in 3:15.71 after Hima Das was obstructed by Oluwakemi Adekoya, who was sprawling on the track after the second baton exchange. India now is the first winner of the event introduced in the Asian Games in 2018 in keeping with the international bid to find gender balance.

Anu Raghavan had clocked her fastest time of 2018, 56.92 seconds in finishing fourth in the hurdles final while her team-mate Jauna Murmu’s second fastest (57.48) gave her the fifth place. Adekoya’s disqualification saw them move to higher places.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mixed-relay-squad-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indian-mixed-relay-squad-given-asian-games-gold/,Athletics
Selfless Bahadur Singh gives credit for rise of Indian athletics to team-work,"July 11, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, July 11: True to his selfless nature, retiring National Chief Coach Bahadur Singh turned the attention away from himself at an emotional farewell function organised through a video conference. Saying the achievements of the Indian athletics fraternity over the past 25 years were due to collective efforts, he called for India to pay more attention to sports in schools.

“If India has risen to be a leading nation in Asian athletics, it is because of one man but because of team-work by athletes, coaches, the Athletics Federation of India, the Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports,” he said. “But if our schools let our children play sport and give them the facilities, India can be a world power.”

Bahadur Singh also pointed out that India sorely missed an indoor training facility. “We spend a lot of money in sending our athletes overseas when the climate at home does not permit training. India badly needs an indoor facility,” he said at an event that had more than 12000 views on Facebook and had a reach of more than 67,000

Saluting the 74-year-old athlete-turned-coach, Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Kiren Rijiju Mr. Rijiju recalled that he had been motivated by Bahadur Singh’s feat to be a shot putter himself in his school days. “Bahadur Singh has been an inspirational personality over five decades and rendered great service with his commitment, dedication and discipline,” he said. SAI Director General Sandip Pradhan also thanked Bahadur Singh for his contribution to Indian athletics.

Athletics legends Sriram Singh, PT Usha and Anju Bobby George shared their memories of Bahadur Singh. The 1976 Olympic Games 800m finalist, Sriram Singh recalled they had both started their Asian Games careers in Tehran in 1974 and completed the NIS coaching diploma in 1980. “Bahadur Singh had contributed immensely to the growth of Indian athletics,” he said.

Usha, fourth in the 1984 Olympic Games 400m hurdles, recalled that she was a teenager when she travelled with Bahadur Singh to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. “He was already a renowned athlete and inspired everyone with his hard work and dedication to training. As chief coach, he would motivate the coaches to do their best,” Usha said.

India’s first World Athletics Championships medalist, long jumper Anju Bobby George remembered her debut in the Commonwealth Games in 2002 when she was lying sixth with only one jump left. “We were trying to communicate in sign language but unable to understand one another, but he folded his hands in prayer and asked me to jump. I secured bronze,” she said.

M.R. Poovamma and Hima Das spoke for the current batch of athletes in national camp and said they would miss his genial personality by the trackside. “Bahadur sir has always encouraged us to rise to great heights and we recognise the sacrifices that he has made while making his priceless knowledge available to us,” Poovamma said.

Speaking for overseas coaches, Olympic medalist Galina Bukharina said Bahadur Singh treated every coach with respect. “He used his authority very differently, setting high targets and teaching everyone the value of success and results,” she said. Javelin throw coach Uwe Hohn said he respected Bahadur Singh for helping create the best possible conditions for athletes to train.

Bahadur Singh’s daughter Birpal Kaur, who logged in from Canada, and grand-daughter Dr. Jannat Sekhon,offered glimpses into a different facet of his personality. “My greatest memory of my father is his holding the National flag and wearing the legend ‘India’ on his back,” Birpal Kaur said, saying that while he had formally retired, she believed he would be at NIS before long,

Indian Olympic Association President Dr. Narinder Dhur Batra recalled watching Bahadur Singh be a self-reliant man despite being 73 years of age during the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018. He complimented the retiring Chief Coach for creating a great culture in the Indian athletics camps and for his achivements.IOA Secretary-General Rajiv Mehta said he would remember Bahadur Singh as always smiling and, with his simple approach, helping Indian athletics.

AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla, who welcomed the online gathering, said he would remember Bahadur Singh as the epitome of sportsmanship and for his will to fight to win. “He took over as Chief Coach when India got only three athletics medals in the 1994 Asian Games and steered the team to 20 medals in 2018,” he said.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot who was AFI Secretary-General when Bahadur Singh was made coach of the junior team in 1991 and of the senior team in 1994, spoke highly of Bahadur Singh’s unmatched vision and honesty. “He would always put others’ interest before his own and dedicated his entire life to athletics,” he said.

Each MILO® GREEN CARD is a fascinating collectible autographed by a famous athlete. Parents can motivate their kids to collect all 6 MILO® GREEN CARDS:  some exciting surprises await those who earn the entire collection.

So it’s not just MILO’s signature choco-malty taste and nourishing energy that kids can look forward to enjoying, while at home.

AFI Planning Committee asks athletes to take advantage of Olympic Postponement,"April 13, 2020","13 April 2020
AFI Media

New Delhi. The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) Planning Committee held an online meeting with the national campers, coaches and support staff on Monday and urged all the athletes to stay mentally strong during the ongoing Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic situation and use the opportunity of Olympic postponement to their advantage.

As most of the elite athletes including the likes of javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, quarter-miler Hima Das, shot putter Tajinder Toor, race walker KT Irfan and India’s men 4x400m men and women relay team members are currently training indoors in their rooms at various national camps during lockdown, the AFI Planning Committee encouraged athletes to maintain their physical fitness and strictly follow their diet charts.

AFI President, Adille J Sumariwalla, told athletes, “We are really glad that all of you are fit and safe at the camps in Patiala, Bengaluru and Ooty. With Olympics 2020 being postponed to 2021 and World Championships, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games scheduled to take place in 2022, it will be a tough challenge for you all. We have to use this opportunity of delay to our advantage and you have to be mentally prepared for these challenges from today itself. With the changed scenario and back to back major events planned for next two years, we will have to adapt to single phase of competition period,”

“We will try to resume our domestic competitions from September-October 2020 and for next year from March-April 2021. With the postponement of Olympics, we hope that now many young athletes also stand a chance to qualify for the Olympics 2021 while seniors need to focus on their existing fitness to grab this opportunity. At this stage we cannot say anything about any foreign exposure camp later in the year, but for sure, we will plan for international competitions-cum-training camps for 2021. We are monitoring the situation at the camps and when the situation allows, you will be allowed to train outside after the consultation with SAI,” he said.

The online meeting was attended by more than 50 athletes and around 30 members of coaching team along with AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K Bhanot, National Chief Coach Bahadur Singh, Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair and Volker Hermann, AFI High Performance Director.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/advantage-of-olympic-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-planning-committee-asks-athletes-to-take-advantage-of-olympic-postponement/,Athletics
Indian athletes will look to make impact on Global Stage,"September 27, 2019","Doha (Qatar), September 26: Metric miler Jinson Johnson and the 4x400m mixed relay team will lead the Indian challenge in the IAAF World Athletics Championships, the most competitive of sporting events with 2043 athletes representing 210 countries and territories, at the Khalifa Stadium here from Friday.

 

The 27-member Indian squad will be looking to turn in performances that will reflect the Athletics Federation of India’s vision of rising above continental meets and making an impact at the global level. They are well aware that it entails a lot of hard work besides remaining injury-free. Their hunger and commitment will be on display in the 10-day event.

 

The expectations from Jinson Johnson are built on the foundation of his good run recently in Berlin where he clocked a National record time of 3:35.24. He has trained at high altitude in Colorado Springs since then and can be expected to race well in the World Championships. The 4x400m mixed relay team will seek to justify the immense faith show in the squad.

 

There is no doubt that India will feel the absence of two of its leading athletes, javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and 400m sprinter Hima Das. Both have the experience of winning gold at the World Junior Championships, but injuries have kept them out of the World Championships here. Yet, the morale of the squad is high as each athlete will attempt to give his or her best.

 

Long jumper M Sreeshankar will be the first Indian on view in the World Championships, taking part in the qualification round on Friday. He had qualified for the meet with an 8.20m effort in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneswar last year but has spent time in rehabilitation after picking up a heel injury. He cleared 8.00m in the Indian Grand Prix in Patiala last month.

MP Jabir and Ayyasamy Dharun, entered in the men’s 400m Hurdles, are be the other Indians slated to be view on the opening day of competition. Of course, Dharun has not taken part in a hurdles race since the Federation Cup in Patiala in March, having only recently returned to track after an injury. The race experience is expected to stand him in good stead.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/India-Team-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indian-athletes-will-look-to-make-impact-on-global-stage/,Athletics
AFI names 25-member squad for the IAAF World Championships,"September 9, 2019","New Delhi, September 8: The Athletics Federation of India selection committee on Monday picked a 25-member national team including 16 men and nine women for the IAAF World Championships to be held in Doha, Qatar, from September 27 to October 6. With less than a year to go for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the well-prepared squad will carry the hopes of the track and field fans of the country.

 

The AFI believes that the 4x400m relay teams will all perform better than they did in the World Relays in Yokohama in May last. “We have invested a lot of time in the 400m runners, getting them to train under renowned coach Galina Bukharina. We believe that the squad has been well prepared to deliver the best results on the World stage,” AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla said.

 

Metric miler Jinson Johnson, who is now training with Coach Scott Simmons in Colarado Springs, United States of America, has caught the eye with his consistency. In the recent months, he improved his own National record in the 1500m twice, first with a time of 3:37.62 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, on June 15 and then 3:35.24 in Berlin on September 1 to make the grade.

 

Long jumper M Sreeshankar, among the first Indians to attain the IAAF qualifying standard with a leap of 8.20m in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneswar in September last year, has regained form after a heel injury kept him away from the Asian Championships in Doha in April. He recently found the 8.00m mark again and will gain from competing in the big stage.

 

While 400m runner Arokia Rajiv is unavailable due to injury, the selectors decided to discuss the case of javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra who is undergoing rehabilitation programme after an elbow surgery at a later stage.Selection committee also approved the names of sprinters Dutee Chand (100m Women), ArchanaSuseentran (200m Women) and high jumper Tejaswin Shankar subject to invitation from IAAF based on their world rankings. The committee also decided to conduct confirmatory trial for quarter miler Anjali Devi for selection in the team in individual women’s 400m. The trial will be conducted on 21st September 2019 at NS-NIS Patiala. 

 

The AFI selection committee meeting, chaired by Olympian Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, was attended by AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla, Chief Coach Bahadur Singh, Bahadur Singh Saggu, Krishna Poonia, Praveen Jolly,UdayPrabhu, Paramjit Singh. Former Chief Coach JS Saini and Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair were special invitees.

 

The team:

 

Men– Jabir MP (400m Hurdles), Jinson Johnson (1500m), Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), KT Irfan and Devender Singh (20km Race Walk), Gopi T (Marathon),Sreeshankar M (Long Jump), Tajinder Pal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Shivpal Singh (Javelin Throw), MuhammedAnas, Nirmal Noah Tom, Alex Antony, Amoj Jacob, KS Jeevan, DharunAyyasamy and Harsh Kumar (4x400m Men’s & MixedRelay).

Chithra’s repeat 1500m gold marks India 17-medal finish,"April 25, 2019","AFI Media

Doha, April 24: PU Chithra struck gold in the women’s 1500m, there were two silver medals through Ajay Kumar Saroj (men’s 1500m) and the women’s 4x400m relay team as well as a women’s 200m bronze for Dutee Chand as India finished with 17 medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze) in the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships here on Wednesday.

There was disappointment as the Indian men’s 4x400m team of Kunhu Mohammed, KS Jeevan, Muhammed Anas Yahiya and Arokia Rajiv, which had finished second in 3:03.28 was disqualified under rule 163.2 (causing impediment to an athlete by jostling or obstructing).  Arokia Rajiv moved up from third place at the start of the anchor leg with an explosive effort, but in vain.

The day has started with Chithra winning gold. “After losing to the Bahrainis in the Asian Games in Jakarta, I was keen to get some revenge. I am happy I made it in a slow-paced race and defended by 2017 title,” Chithra said after winning in 4:14.56. Of course, her time was slower than the season’s best of 4:13.58 but it was led by simple tactics of being with the Bahrain duo and sprinting past them in the final lap.

Kazakhstan’s Tatyana Neroznak set the early pace, but it was Gashwaw Tigest who controlled the race after the first lap. With 300m left, she was still in the lead while Winfred Mutile Yavi, attempting a treble crown after winning the 5000m and 3000m steeplechase, was not too far behind with the Indian on her heels.

Chithra started her kick midway through the back straight on the last lap and slipped past Winfred Yavi on the bend and then set herself up to pass Gashaw Tigest on the outside on the final home straight. The Bahraini tried hard to keep the Asian Games bronze medallist at bay, but without success as the 23-year-old pushed on relentlessly to retain gold.

The photo-finish camera was needed to separate Ajay Kumar Saroj from Qatar’s Musaab Ali and get him the men’s 1500m silver medal behind Abraham Kipchirchir Rotich (Bahrain). The Indian was credited with a time of 3:43.18 and six-thousands of a second ahead of the Qatar runner. Ajay Saroj, who won gold in Bhubaneswar in 2017, came up with a stirring run on the home stretch.

It was the second time that the photo-finish cameras favoured India on Wednesday evening. Sprinter Dutee Chand endured a fairly long wait after sustaining her pace over 200m while several others slowed down after expending energy over the first 100m and more. She took bronze in 23.24 seconds, edging out Bahrain’s Edidiong Odiong by one-thousandth of a second.

Salwa Naser (Bahrain) completed a 200-400m double with a championship record time of 22.74 seconds, showing Kazakhstan’s Olga Safronova a clean pair of heels. It was the second time in three nights that she took Sri Lankan sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe’s record, having claimed the 400m mark on Monday.

Gavit Murli Kumar came up with a personal best time of 13:48.99 in the men’s 5000m where he finished fifth but it does not reflect the gallant effort that he made along with Abhishek Pal for a large part of the race. Bahrain’s Birhanu Balew and Albert Rop were easy winners of gold and silver and Murli gave up after he was passed by Japan’s Hiroki Matsueda over the last 300m.

Without Hima Das, the Indian women’s 4x400m quartet finished with silver in 3:32.21 despite a terrific third leg (52.99 seconds) by Saritaben Gayakwad. Prachi, MR Poovamma and Saritaben Gayakwad could not give VR Vismaya enough lead and she could not stave off a surge by Salwa Naser (Bahrain) on the anchor leg.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chitra-repeats-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/chithras-repeat-1500m-gold-marks-india-17-medal-finish/,Athletics
Gomathi Marimuthu secures India’s first gold medal in Doha AAC,"April 22, 2019","Gomathi Marimuthu secures India’s first gold medal in Doha AAC

AFI Media

Doha, April 22: Gomathi Marimuthu scripted an amazing story and made a dream come true by winning the women’s 800m gold at the Asian Athletics Championships at the Khalifa Stadium here on Monday. It was India’s first gold medal after three silver, including for javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, and five bronze medals.

Gomathi clocked a personal best of 2:02.70 with a gallant run over the final lap after being pushed to sixth place just after the bell. On the back straight, she went past a pair of Sri Lankan runners and moved to third place with 200m left. Running on the outside, the 30-year-old could sense Kazakhstan’s Margarita Mukasheva and the leader Wang Chunyu losing pace. And she willed herself to sustain her charge till the gold was won.

This was third time lucky for Gomathi, who had finished seventh in the Asian Championship in 2013 and fourth in 2015. She had to come through a confirmatory trial in Patiala where she was paced by quartermiler MR Poovamma. She did not need such support on the track this time as she drew from the energy and intensity to deliver a good performance.

Shivpal Singh also came up with a personal best of 86.23m with his second throw to secure the silver medal behind Chinese Taipei’s Chao-Tsun Cheng who fouled his first throw but flung the spear over a championship record distance of 86.72m. After a third throw of 83.46m, he preferred to pass the other throws fearing an adductor injury.

Shivpal Singh, who opened with 80.89m, had another throw over 81.39m and try as he might, could not dislodge the Chinese Taipei champion from the pedestal. He had the consolation of going past compatriot Neeraj Chopra’s meet mark of 85.23m set with his very last throw in Bhubaneshwar in 2017.

The 400m hurdlers Saritaben Gayakwad and MP Jabir each gave India a bronze medal from the women and men’s races. Both had to overcome the challenge of moving up from the lower positions to the podim. Saritaben Gayakwad clocked 57.22, a shade below her season’s best, while Jabir produced a personal best time of 49.13 seconds.

On Sunday night, the men’s 3000m steeplechase saw Avinash Sable produce a dramatic finish by passing two runners at the final water jump and the final hurdle to secure a creditable silver medal on international debut. His time of 8:30.19 was not far off the National record of 8:28.94 that he set in Patiala last month.

MR Poovamma had to settle for a bronze in the women’s 400m after a photo-finish was used to separate her from the silver medallist Elina Mikhina (Kazakhstan). The race was won with comfort by Salwa Naser of Bahrain. Poovamma clocked 53.21 seconds and her bronze medal was some consolation for India after Hima Das pulled up injured in the semifinal heats.

Gavit Murli Kumar completed India’s five-medal hunt on the opening night when he won bronze in the men’s 10000m to add to the silver that Annu Rani claimed in the women’s javelin throw and the bronze that Parul Chaudhary got by beating compatriot Sanjivani Jadhav on the final straight.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gomathi-marimuthu-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/gomathi-marimuthu-secures-indias-first-gold-medal-in-doha-aac/,Athletics

AFI Media

Doha, April 21: Annu Rani claimed the women’s javelin throw silver medal in the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships with a throw of 60.22m at the Khalifa Stadium here today. Distance runner Parul Chaudhary had opened India’s medal hunt with a bronze in the women’s 5000m, slipping past a tiring compatriot Sanjivani Jadhav in the final lap of the gruelling race.

Parul Chaudhary settled to a comfortable pace, unmindful of the leading trio pulling away midway through the race and, drawing on her experience of running marathons to gain ground on Sanjivani Jadhav steadily. She finished with her personal best of 15:36.03, a significant improvement on the 15:58.35 she clocked in Patiala last month.

“I did not worry about the leaders stepping up the pace. I ran according to plan and how my body felt,” the 24-year-old Parul Chaudhary said. Sanjivani Jadhav’s 15:41.12 was her season’s best. She was disappointed at not been able to shadow the Bahrain runners Winfred Mutile Yavi and Bontu Rebitu till the finish.

Annu Rani focused on doing well in the competition, not letting her mind go back to the time she threw a disappointing 53.93m in the Asian Games in Jakarta. Her opening throw went past the 60m mark even though she was conservative in throwing from well behind the line. It was good enough to get silver tonight. Her team-mate Sharmila Kumari was seventh with a best of 54.48m.

“I was keen on doing well this evening. I knew I had trained well for the event,” Annu Rani, 26, said. Her second throw of 58.86m and a fourth of 56.56m would have got her silver. “I was pumped up and would have got my career best today had I not thrown from far behind the line.”

China’s Lyu Huihui set a new Championship record with her opening throw of 64.92 and raised it to 65.83m to be a clear winner of gold medal.

The two medals came as a boost to the Indian contingent that was downcast after Hima Das pulled with a back injury halfway through her 400m heats in the morning. The young Indian slowed down near the 180m mark and then clutched her lower back as she felt pain due to spasms. She then lay sprawled on the track as the other runners sped away.

The morning session also had some wonderful news for India as Dutee Chand clocked a National record time of 11.28 seconds in the women’s 100m dash, MR Poovamma came up with a season’s best time of 52.46 seconds in finishing second in her 400m semifinal heats behind title favourite Salwa Naser (Bahrain).

In the two-lap race, Gomathi Marimuthu ensured that there would be an Indian representation in the final as she came home in 2:04.96 in the fast first semifinal heats. Twinkle Chaudhary made a game attempt to catch up with the leaders by straining every sinew in the second semifinal heats but finished fourth in 2:07.00 and missed a berth in the final.

India’s men’s 400m and 800m runners advanced to the semifinals as well. Arokia Rajiv won his first round heats in 46.25 seconds while Muhammad Anas Yahiya did enough to finish third in his heats in 46.36 seconds and assure himself of a semifinal spot. Jinson Johnson (1:53.43) and Mohammed Afsal (1:52.93) advanced to the 800m semifinals.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/annu-rani-asian-athletics-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/annu-rani-claims-javelin-silver-parul-chaudhary-gets-5000m-bronze/,Athletics
"Toor, Johnson, Swapna Barman expected to replicate Asian Games success in AAC2019","April 20, 2019","AFI Media

Doha, April 20: Asian Games gold medallists shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, middle-distance runner Jinson Johnson, heptathlete Swapna Barman and the women’s 4x400m squad will headline the Indian challenge in the four-day Asian Athletics Championships, beginning at the Khalifa Stadium here on Sunday.

The 24-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor has been consistently going past the 19m mark for five years now and his 20.13m in the Grand Prix in Patiala in February has placed the Asian Games gold medallist as the early leader in the continent. Jinson Johnson’s powerful kick has earned him a reputation and will take to the track with confidence.

Swapna Barman has ruled the roost in the heptathlon, winning gold in the 2017 Asian Atheltics Championships and the Asian Games in Jakarta last year. She will look to complete a hat-trick of Asian crowns. The women’s 4x400m relay team, with its focus on the IAAF World Relays next month, will want to make improvements to its time.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra’s elbow injury and 400m hurdler Ayyasamy Dharun’s stress fracture have kept them away from the competition. Long jumper S Sreeshankar, whose heel injury prevented him from competing in the Federation Cup in Patiala last month, and triple jumper Arpinder Singh are the other big guns who will miss the Asian Athletics Championships.

However, there is an opportunity for others to shine in a quality competition. Their performances will be keenly watched to see how athletes like Gavit Murali Kumar and Avinash Sable come of age. Gavit Murali Kumar and Abhishek Pal in the 5000m and Avinash Sable and Shankar Lal Swami in the steeplechase are capable athletes as is 23-year-old Mohammed Afsal, who has been picked to replace Manjit Singh in the middle-distance events.

India has roped in Davinder Singh Kang in Neeraj Chopra’s place in the squad. It is hopeful that he will rediscover the big-meet temperament that made him India’s first finalist in the men’s javelin throw in the 2017 IAAF World Athletics Championship in London. With Shivpal Singh already throwing beyond 80m this season, they can expect a medal between them.

On Sunday, Annu Rani has the opportunity to show that she has overcome memories of a sixth-place finish in javelin event the Asian Games in Jakarta. She recorded a throw of 62.34m in the Federation Cup in Patiala last month and will expect to give the Chinese a run for their money when she steps up the runway on Sunday.

The women’s 400m final will hold a lot of interest. The team’s coaching staff and the runners are well aware that the season top list – where Hima Das and M R Poovamma lead a bunch nine Indians in the top 10 in Asia – is no real indication of what to expect in the competition here. They will seek medals and then get down to working towards improving the time in the 4x400m relay.

Avinash Sable, who broke Gopal Saini’s old men’s 3000m steeplechase National record and then lowered it in the Federation Cup, could be up against seasoned competitors but has the potential to run a tactical race and make his maiden Asian competition memorable while Parul Chaudhary will have to come up with her best against Chinese and Japanese runners in the women’s 5000m.

Gavit Murali Kumar, who finished sixth in the men’s 5000m in the Asian Championships in Bhubaneshwar in July 2017, and Abhishek Pal, who was Asian junior silver medallist in 2016, will have to run a smart race.

Patiala: Dutee Chand anchored a new-look 4x100m women’s relay team to qualify for the Asian Athletics Championships to be held in Doha from April 21 with a time of 44.12 seconds at the confirmatory trial at the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports here today. Hina, Archana Suseendran and Ranga K ran the first three legs.

It was heartening to see 400m runner MR Poovama try her hand at pace setting for the two athletes running the 800m by leading them through a quick first lap. Gomathi K made the most of that to finish in 2:04.12 well inside the qualifying standards of 2:05.00. Twinkle Chaudhary missed out by finishing in 2:09.44.

The coaches decided to put most of the 400m runners through a 200m sprint since the electronic timer was available on track. And they were happy with the times clocked by the quartermilers who are being prepared for the World Relay Challenge in Japan next month.

The seasoned MR Poovamma led the women finishers in 24.05 seconds ahead of Hima Das (24.21) and Shubha (24.83) while Arokia Raj broke the beam in the men’s race in 20.72 seconds ahead of Muhammad Anas Yahiya (21.09) and Jabir (21.76).

"PREVIEW: Vismaya favorite in 400m, Jinson set for comeback in 1500m","March 13, 2019","AFI Media
13/03/2019

New Delhi. Indian Grand Prix winner VK Vismaya will lead a strong field in the women’s 400 metres event at the 23rd senior Federation Cup Athletics Championships in Patiala. The country’s most prestigious athletics competition will be held at the National Institute of Sport from March 15-18, 2019.

Hima Das, the Asian Games silver medallist and the World junior gold medallist will be a part of a strong field, which includes the likes of Poovamma MR, SaritabenGayakwad, Jisna Mathews, Sonia Baishya and Anjali Devi. All the members of the 4X400 metres relay will be participating in the 400 metres heats, which will take place on Sunday, March 17 at 9.40 am.

The Fed Cup will also be the final opportunity for Indian athletes to qualify for the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships to be held in Doha from April 21-24.

“We expect roughly the same number of medals as that from last Asian Championships held in Bhubaneswar in 2017, about 30. In Patiala, we don’t expect the same performance from Hima Das as her last year’s show at the Fed Cup. She has been busy with her exams and that has hampered her preparations. We expect that the women’s 400 metres will be an exciting contest, apart from the men’s 800 and 1500 metres,” said Athletics Federation of India official RK Radhakrishnan.

The men’s equivalent of the quarter-mile will also witness steep competition, with triple silver medallist from Jakarta, Muhammad Anas Yahiya, leading the pack.

Anas, who also holds the National Record, will be joined by Arokia Rajiv, Sachin Roby, Muhammad Kunhu and 400 metres hurdles national record holder AyyasamyDharun.

Silver medallist in the 100 and 200 metres at Jakarta, Dutee Chand, will also be the star attraction in the same events at the Fed Cup. Dutee will also likely face off against Hima Das in the 200 metres event. Amiya Kumar Mullick and VK ElakkiyaDasan are among the favourites in the men’s 100 and 200 metres.

The men’s 1500 metres event will witness an interesting three-way contest between Jinson Johnson, Manjit Singh and Asian Athletics Championships gold medallist Ajay Kumar Saroj. Johnson, having pipped to the 800 metres title in Jakarta by Manjit, will compete against him in the same event at the Fed Cup.

The women’s 1500 metres will see upcoming stars Lili Das and PU Chitra try to out-do each other. Maharashtra’s ArchanaAdhav will also provide strong competition to the two runners.

Indian Athletics team finish Asian Games 2018 with 7 gold medals,"August 30, 2018","AFI Media
30 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). India finished the 2018 Asian Games with a total of 7 gold, 10 silver and 2 bronze medals in Athletics. This was India’s second highest medal tally in Athletics ever at the Asiad, as the contingent finished the final day of athletics action with two gold medals.

The women’s 4X400 metre relay team kept a streak of four Asian Games gold medals alive, stretching it to five in Jakarta.

Hima Das ran the lead leg of the race for team India, giving team India a solid start, and she was followed by Saritaben Gaikwad and MR Poovamma, who extended the gap between India and the rest of the teams. As women’s individual 400 metres gold medallist Salwa Eid Naser chased VK Vismaya, the latter ran a composed race to finish well ahead of the Bahrain team to clinch gold. This was Hima Das’ third medal of these Asian Games, to go with her silver in the 400 metres individual race and the mixed 4X400 relay.

National record holder Jinson Johnson won silver in the 800 metres, but he was not to be denied in the 1500, as Jinson won the gold, making it two medals for the Kerala runner at the 2018 Asian Games.

Johnson ran a superb, tactical race, holding back till the final 300 metres to start pushing the pace of the race as a late kick won him his first Asiad gold. The 27-year-old had broken Bahadur Prasad’s national record in the event at the Inter-State Championships.

Manjit Singh, the 800 metres gold medallist, ran a similar race to his winning run earlier, but left his charge too late to finish fourth, denying him a chance to win two medals.

The men’s 4X400 relay team brought home India’s 19th and final athletics medal, a silver. Kunhu Muhammed ran the lead leg, followed by Ayyasamy Dharun. By the time India’s fastest quarter-miler Muhammed Anas took over in the 3rd leg, Qatar’s lead was too much and despite his and Arokia Rajiv’s best efforts, the male quarter could not make up the deficit.

Seema Punia finished with a bronze in the women’s Discus Throw, managing a seasonal best of 62.26 metres, finishing behind two Chinese throwers. Punia added a bronze to her gold medal at Incheon four years ago. Sandeep Kumari finished fifth, managing a best attempt of 54.61 metres.

PU Chitra bagged India’s second bronze of the day in the women’s 1500 metres final. The 2017 Asian Athletics Championships winner Chitra won the race in a time of 4:12.56.

Govindan Lakshmanan finished 6th in the 5,000 metres final, as he came home in a time of 14:17.09. Bahrain’s Birhanu Balew won the race with a time of 13:43.17.

Sandeep Kumar was disqualified in the men’s 50 km race for three faults.

Manjit becomes first man in 36 years to win 800m gold at Asiad,"August 28, 2018","AFI Media
28 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Manjit Singh became the first Indian man in 36 years to win gold in the 800 metres at the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang.

Singh, who was a 2010 Commonwealth Games semifinalist and a runner-up at the 2018 Federation Cup and Inter-State Championships, won the race in a time of 1:46.15 seconds, finishing ahead of fellow countryman and favorite Jinson Johnson.

Johnson, the national record holder in the 800 metres, having broken Sriram Singh’s 42-year-old mark had pipped Manjit to two domestic titles this year, won the silver medal clocking 1:46.35. This was the first instance of India winning the gold and silver medals in the men’s 800 metres since the inaugural Asiad in New Delhi in 1951.

India’s mixed relay team managed to win a silver medal in the newly introduced 4X400 metres event. The team, comprising of Muhammed Anas, MR Poovamma, Hima Das and Arokia Rajiv finished in a time of 3:15.71. India had opted for a ‘man-woman-woman-man’ formation in the mixed relay, Anas going first followed by Poovamma and Hima as Arokia Rajiv went last.

The Athletics Federation of India have lodged a protest, alleging that Hima Das’ handover was obstructed by a Bahraini runner. A jury will deliberate on this appeal and the results of the appeal are expected by 10 am tomorrow.

Dutee Chand, looking to follow up on her silver medal in the 100 metres, qualified for the final of the women’s 200 metres with a time of 23.00 seconds. Hima Das, in the first semifinal, was disqualified after she jumped the starting gun and was charged with a false start.

Earlier, both women had come through the heats of the competition, Dutee winning her Heat with a time of 23.37 seconds while Hima had qualified as one of the fastest lucky losers, finishing with a time of 23.47 seconds.

At the end of four events in the heptathlon, Swapna Barman currently lies second with 3481 points, 32 behind the leader Wang Qingling of China. Barman, who was in discomfort due to a tooth ache, was brave in competition despite the pain. Purnima Hembram is a further 67 points behind in third place, with 3 events to go.

Annu Rani finished 6th in the women’s Javelin Throw final, as she could muster a highest attempt of 53.93 metres. Rani fouled her final three throws to finish short of the medal places.

In the women’s 5000 metres, Suriya Loganathan was fifth with a time of 15:49.30, behind winner Kalkidan Befkadu of Bahrain.

"Asian Games 2018: Toor breaks Games record, India bags first gold in athletics","August 25, 2018","AFI Media
25 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Tajinder Pal Singh Toor stormed his way to Asian Games gold as the 23-year old shot put thrower from Punjab set a new national record and Asian Games record with a throw of 20.75 metres.

The national record, which previously belonged to Om Prakash Karhana with 20.69 metres was shattered by the left-handed Toor on his fifth attempt. Tajinder had earlier taken the lead with his first attempt of 19.96 metres.

His personal best was 20.40 metres which he had set at the Federation Cup in Patiala in 2017, but there was no stopping Tajinder here as he managed a 20 metre throw in his sixth and final attempt.

He was joined in celebration by his coach Mohinder Singh Dhillon as shot put gave India its ninth gold at the Asiad, making it the most successful discipline for India. Men’s Shot Put has now contributed 19 medals in total, including 3 silver and 7 bronze medals.

Tajinder wasn’t the only Indian athlete to set a new national record, as Hima Das also set a new national record in the women’s 400 metres. The quarter-miler from Assam managed a time of 51 seconds in Heat 1 as she finished second behind Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser, who topped qualification overall with a time of 50.86 s, a new Games record.

Hima broke the record of Manjeet Kaur, set in 2004 by 0.05 seconds. Joining Hima in the semi-finals of the 400 metres was Nirmala Sheoran, who also won her Heat, the third, with a time of 54.09 seconds.

The male quarter-milers also did not disappoint as Muhammad Anas, who came fourth in the Commonwealth Games, won the second semi-final with a time of 45.30 seconds, making him the fastest qualifier.

Arokia Rajiv, who won a bronze in Incheon 4 years ago, was second fastest in the 1st semi-final with a time of 46.08 seconds. Earlier, Anas had won his Heat in the morning, running 45.63 seconds. Arokia had run 46.82 seconds in Heat 4.

Dutee Chand also won her 100 metres Heat with a time of 11.38 seconds, holding off the challenge of Olga Safronova. Chand qualified third fastest overall and will now run in the first semi-final.

Sreeshankar Murali, in his first major international competition, also did well in the Long Jump qualifiers, managing 7.83 metres in his first jump. That attempt was enough for the 19-year old Federation Cup champion to cross the automatic qualification mark of 7.80 seconds and qualify for the final.

Balasubramanya Chethan, India’s entrant in the High Jump competition, did not disappoint, as he cleared 2.15 metres on his second attempt at the height to book a place in the final.

Sarita Singh finished fifth in the Women’s Hammer Throw, with a best attempt of 62.03 metres on her third throw. It was a good performance by the national record holder in a highly competitive field.

28 June 2018

Guwahati. Meet records continued to tumble and athletes continued to earn places in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games, at the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati. Five athletes earned the right to represent India in Jakarta even as six meet records were set in the third day of competition at Guwahati’s Indira Gandhi stadium.

Javelin thrower Shiv Pal Singh became the latest Indian entrant to the 80m + club, winning a gold medal in the event at the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati with a throw of 82.28m. The qualification guideline for the Asian Games was set at 81m by the Athletics Federation of India. The 23-year-old athlete from Uttar Pradesh also shattered the old meet record of 79.67m set by Jagdish Bishnoi in 2000.

Singh was trailing in second place with a best effort of 78.11m before flinging the spear to a personal best mark with his final throw of the competition. He beat out former national record holder Rajender Singh who settled for silver with a throw of 80.63m. Claiming bronze was Uttar Pradesh’s Amit Kumar who had been leading until the final round of throws, with a throw of 78.17m.

Also crossing the qualification guidelines for Asian Games was steeplechaser Sudha Singh. The former national record holder clocked 9.39.59 seconds to both erase her own old meet record of 9:45.60 seconds set in 2013 and also finish under the Asian Games qualifying standard of 9:45.00 seconds. Sudha was the comfortable winner at the Indira Gandhi Stadium, finishing more than 15 seconds clear of second place Chinta Yadav who clocked 9:55.41 seconds. Chavi Yadav made it an all Uttar Pradesh podium, becoming only the fourth Indian woman to finish inside 10 minutes, with a time of 9:56.73 seconds. The race would however prove to be disappointing for national record holder Lalita Babar who was making her return to competition after a year off the track. While Babar had been expected to resume her rivalry with Singh, she would fail to complete the race.

The men’s 3000m steeplechase event would also see an athlete earn the chance to represent the country at the Asian Games. Haryana’s Naveen Kumar Dagar went under the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 8:41.40 seconds as he crossed the finish line first with a time of 8:39.42 seconds. Dagar also broke his own meet record of 8:42.29 seconds set at the 2014 edition of the tournament. Shankar Lal Swamy of Rajasthan and Durga Bahadur of Uttar Pradesh took silver and bronze with times 8:43.52 seconds and 8:46.67 seconds respectively.

Another national record holder, Dutee Chand, shrugged off the disappointment of a defeat earlier in the competition to stamp her class on Thursday. Chand had been beaten to second place in the women’s 200m yesterday by home girl Hima Das, but marked herself out as the athlete to beat with a blistering time of 11.42 seconds in a heat of the women’s 100m sprint. The qualification guidelines for the event had stood at 11.67seconds.

High jumper Balasubramanya Chethan also managed to cross the qualification standard as he cleared a personal best of 2.25m in the men’s high jump competition. Chethan who made a massive 5cm improvement to his personal best, equalled the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 2.25m and also bettered the previous meet record of 2.23m set by Tejaswin Shankar at Guntur last year. Upcoming high jumper V Bharathi of Tamil Nadu cleared a creditable 2.21m to claim silver while Siddharth Yadav of Haryana clinched bronze with a jump of 2.19m.

Khyati Vakharia meanwhile endured a bittersweet moment on the podium in the women’s pole vault event. Although she managed to win gold and also equal her own meet record of 4.00m set in 2013, the 29-year-old from Karnataka fell short of the Asian Games qualifying standard of 4.10m. National record holder VS Surekha claimed silver with a best jump of 3.90m while Maria Jaison of Karnataka settled for bronze with a best effort of 3.70m.

"Jinson Johnson creates history, breaks 42-year old Indian record","June 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 June 2018

Guwahati. Jinson  Johnson created history at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in Guwahati on Wednesday as he shattered the oldest standing record in Indian athletics. The 27-year old from Kerala clocked 1:45.65 seconds to win the gold medal in the men’s 800m event at the 58th National Inter State Championships. In doing so he erased the 42-year-old mark of 1:45.77 seconds set by Sriram Singh at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

It had taken a hard-fought race to push Johnson to the mark with the first four athletes in the race all managing to run inside the qualification guideline of 1:47.50 seconds set by the Athletic Federation of India for the Asian Games. Taking silver behind Johnson was Haryana’s Manjit Singh who clocked 1:46.24 seconds – a mark that was faster than the old meet record of 1:46.26 seconds set by Pankaj Dimri at the 2010 edition of the Inter State Championships. Claiming bronze was Mohammad Afsal of Manipur who clocked 1:46.79 seconds while coming in a credible fourth was Haryana’s Beant Singh who clocked a personal best of 1:46.92 seconds.

Also writing her name into the record books was Assam’s own Hima Das. The 18-year-old sprinter clocked 23.10 seconds to equal the meet record set by Rachita Mistry all the way back in 2000. Das also booked her spot for the Asian Games by finishing under the AFI guideline of 23.50 seconds. Pipped to second place was Orissa’s Dutee Chand who clocked 23.41 seconds. While Chand will be disappointed at having lost out to Das, she would be heartened by the fact that she had also qualified for the Asian Games owing to the fact that her timing matched the AFI’s guidelines. Coming in third place was Srabani Nanda who crossed the finish line in 23.87 seconds.

Despite falling short of the AFI’s guidelines, M Sreeshankar continued to impress. The 19-year-old from Kerala clinched gold in the men’s long jump, yet his best effort of 7.76m was five centimeters short of the AFI’s guidelines for the Asian Games. Sreeshankar who had battled past a case of appendicitis a few months ago, started off strongly, recording jumps of 7.76m in both his first and second efforts but was unable to improve on that mark.  Claiming second was Mehakpreet Singh of Punjab who was trailing in fourth place before he produced a jump of 7.63m in his final attempt. National record holder Ankit Sharma completed the podium with a best of 7.61m.

There would be brief excitement in the men’s pole vault competition too with two athletes setting meet records but neither would be able to come close to the AFI’s qualification guidelines for the Asian Games. Kundan Kumar of Haryana cleared 5.15m to erase the old meet record of 5.05m set by Ganjan Upadhyay  in 2007 while Siva Subrami of Tamil Nadu managed to equal that height. Anoop CB of Kerala took bronze with a clearance of 4.95m.

There would be disappointment for Muhammad Anas who was expected to come close to the National record in the men’s 200m race. Anas had come into the tournament having set a personal best of 20.76seconds a few weeks back and had appeared in good form in Tuesday’s heats setting a time of 20.95 seconds. However, he only managed to clock 20.97 seconds in what was still a gold medal winning performance. Tamil Nadu’s Elakkiya Dasan came in second with 21.31 seconds while Parveen Kumar of Haryana clinched bronze with a time of 21.43 seconds.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jinson-Johnson-creates-history-breaks-42-year-old-Indian-record.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/jinson-johnson-creates-history-breaks-42-year-old-indian-record/,Athletics
Will it be a SUPER SATURDAY for India at CWG,"April 13, 2018","AFI Media
13 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra led the charge of the Indian athletics contingent at the Carrara Stadium on Friday. Faced with the task of clearing a mark of 78m to automatically qualify for the final of the javelin throw event, the 20-year-old needed just one attempt to fling the spear a distance of 80.42m. Chopra might have been able to exceed that mark but chose not to take the next two attempts in an effort to conserve energy for the finals. Chopra has a season’s best of 85.93m recorded at the Federation Cup last month, while his personal best of 86.48m recorded at the IAAF U20 World Championships is the current national record. At the finals on Saturday, Chopra would be itching to increase that record by some margin.

Chopra wasn’t the only Indian to make it to the finals though. Teammate Vipin Kasana also made just one attempt at the javelin throw, clearing a distance of 78.88m. The result was a marked improvement compared to his effort at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. At that event, Kasana, 30, was only able to record a best of 71.95m in qualifying round and did not proceed to the finals.

Neeraj’s throw wasn’t the best of the day. Four other throwers managed better performances than him.  Hamish Peacock of Australia topped qualifying with a throw of 81.22m while Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan and Anderson Peters of Grenada were second and third with a throw of 80.45m and 80.44m respectively. Unlike Chopra and Kasana, those athletes didn’t have it easy. None of them managed to clear the mark of 78m in their first or second throws. Peacock had efforts of 74.58m and 76.49m. Pakistan’s Nadeem had a foul throw before recording a legal throw above the 80m mark. Peters of Grenada too kept his best for last with throws of 76.93m and 76.08m before clearing the qualifying standard.

One shock absentee from the final is Kenya’s Julius Yego. The Olympic silver medalist and former world champion had a personal best of 92.72m and throw of 87.97m last season. The Kenyan had been out of form in the run up to the Games. Yego, only managed throws of 74.55m and 73.67m but failed to cross the qualifying standard.

India also qualified for the final of the men’s 4x400m relay. The team anchored by Arokia Rajiv comprised Amoj Jacob, Mohammand Anas and K Suresh finished second in their heats with a time of 3.04.05 seconds, just short of top ranked Jamaica who crossed the finish line in 3.03.97 seconds. Bahamas finished third with 3.04.62 seconds. The other heat was won by favorites Botswana who in fact clocked a slower time than India (3.05.01 seconds) while Kenya and Fiji finished second and third with a time of 3.13.52seconds and 3.19.19 seconds. With India having qualified second for the final, with the second fastest time, the team, helmed by national record holder Mohammad Anas, would be expected to finish on the podium.

The Indian 4x400m women’s team comprising MR Poovamma, Saritaben Gayakwad, Soniya Baishya and Hima Das will also look for a podium finish in the finals tomorrow. With just eight teams entering the competition, there were no qualifying heats for this event today.

India capped the day with a bit of good news. Purnima Hembram finished seventh in the women’s heptathlon but managed to finish with a new personal best. Hembram added 837 points in the long jump with a leap of 5.96m, 697 points with a best effort of 41.57m in the javelin throw and 859 points in the women’s 800m with a time of 2.17.44 seconds. Hembram finished with a total of 5834 points to finish in 7th place in a tough group.

Meanwhile in men’s triple jump final on Saturday, India’s hopes rests with Arpinder Singh who qualified for the finals earlier on Wednesday.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Will-it-be-a-SUPER-SATURDAY-for-India-at-CWG.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/will-it-be-a-super-saturday-for-india-at-cwg/,Athletics
"Seema wins fourth CWG medal, Navjeet bags bronze","April 12, 2018","AFI Media
12 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). India athletes opened their account at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games 2018 winning two medals in the women’s discus throw competition. Competing at Gold Coast’s Carrara Stadium,  Seema Antil Punia and Navjeet Dhillon won the silver and bronze medals respectively with throws of 60.41m and 57.43m.

Punia’s silver was her fourth consecutive medal at the Commonwealth Games. She had earlier won a silver at the 2006 edition in Melbourne, a bronze at the 2010 Games in Delhi, a silver at the Glasgow Games before her podium finish at Gold Coast. Punia, 34, threw the discus to the silver medal winning distance in her very first throw of the competition.

She failed to improve on that first effort of 60.41m. Punia recorded throws of 59.57m in her second attempt, a foul throw in her third, an effort of 58.54m in her fourth followed by another foul and a final effort of 58.90m. It was short of her seasons best of 61.05m recorded at the Federation Cup last month and of her personal best of 64.84m recorded 14 years back in Kiev. Neither of those efforts would be enough overcome Australia’s Dani Stevens who flung the discus a massive 68.26m for a new Games Record.

While Punia won her fourth medal, Navjeet Kaur Dhillon won her first ever medal at the Commonwealth Games. It was a medal won right at the brink of defeat. As she stepped up to take her final throw of the competition, Dhillon was trailing in fourth place with a best throw  56.22m, nearly a meter short of New Zealand’s Sositina Hakeai who had thrown 57.16m. Dhillon though managed to record a throw of 57.43m with her very final attempt to pip the Kiwi. It was the biggest senior international medal won by Dhillon, who four years earlier had joined Punia as one of only two Indian women to have won a World junior medal.

There was disappointment in store for the other two Indian women competing for a medal at Gold Coast. Long jumpers Nayana James and V Neena had poor days finishing 12th and 10th in the field of 12 athletes in the final. James, who had a personal best of 6.55m could only record a best jump of 6.14m in her three attempts. The effort would have been particularly disappointing for James had recorded a jump of 6.34m simply to qualify for the final a couple of days ago. It was a similar story for Neena also. The athlete had a personal best jump of 6.66m but could only clear 6.19 on Thursday. That jump too was short of her effort of 6.24m to qualify for the final.

CK Valson, Secretary AFI, said from Gold Coast, “We are extremely pleased with Seema and Navjeet’s performance today. We expected a medal in Women’s discus throw and we got two. We are also very happy with the results of Mohammed Anas and Hima Das in 400m events,”

“However, results were not satisfactory in Women’s long jump event. Both athletes (Nayana James and Neena Verakil) were expected to do better. There are still few events left such as Men’s Javelin Throw and Triple Jump in which we can expect a medal each,” said Valson.

The day however ended with the promise of better fortunes on Friday. After Four events on Thursday, Heptathlete Purnima Hembram was in sixth place with 3441 points. Purnima Hembram recorded a recorded a  time of 13.56m in the 110m hurdles for 1041 points, jumped a height of 1.72m in the high jump for another 879 points, threw the shot put 11.75m for 645 points before then clocked 25.12 seconds in the 200m for 876 points. With three events remaining – long jump, javelin throw and the 800m – Hembram will be hopeful of climbing up from her position and even perhaps recording a personal best.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seema-wins-fourth-CWG-medal-Navjeet-bags-bronze.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/seema-wins-fourth-cwg-medal-navjeet-bags-bronze/,Athletics
Anas scripts history at CWG 2018,"April 9, 2018","AFI Media
09 April 2018

Gold Coast. Muhammed Anas Yahiya became the first Indian man to qualify for the 400m final at the Commonwealth Games since the legendary Milkha Singh. National record holder Anas, won his semifinal heat in the men’s 400m race with a time a 45.44 seconds to qualify for the Gold Coast CWG2018 final to be held on Tuesday. Anas’ time was slower than the national record of 45.32 seconds but it was enough to mark him the third fastest Indian in a high qualify final field.

Joining Anas in the final of his event was the high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. Competing in his first Commonwealth Games, the 19-year-old did not have to break much sweat as he qualified for the high jump finals having cleared the cutoff of 2.21m. Shankar started with a height of 2.10m and then progressed to 2.15m where he made a single foul jump before clearing that height too. A successful jump at 2.18m was then followed by a missed clearance at 2.21m. There would be no mistake on his second attempt as Shankar made it to the 13-man final.

Hima Das also advanced to the semifinals of the women’s 400m with relative ease. Das, who is only 18 and only began running the 400m a few months ago, ran a fast 52.11 seconds to qualify as the third fastest runner of the last of five heats. Das’ time was close to her personal best of 51.97 seconds and she will only look to improve on that time in the semifinals of her event to be held on Tuesday.

However, India’s wait for a medal in athletics continued into the second day of the competition with Tejinder Pal Toor and L Suriya falling short in the final of the shot put and women’s 10000m event respectively.

Competing in a strong 12-man field, Toor had a poor evening at the Carrara Stadium. At the end of the first three throws, Toor barely made to the final eight (which allowed him to make three more throws. Toor, who threw 19.42m in his third attempt, never managed to exceed that mark, following with throws of 18.87, a foul throw and a last attempt of 18.63m. Toor had a personal best of 20.40m and had qualified for the Games with an effort of 20.24m at the Federation Cup last month but even those would have not been enough on the day with the bronze medal going at 20.91m to Canada’s Tim Nedow. Tomas Walsh and Chupwuebuka Enekwechi won gold and silver at 21.41m and 21.14m respectively.

Loganathan Suriya also finished out of the medal bracket but will have no regrets about her performance in the women’s 10000m. Suriya ran a personal best time of 32.23.56 seconds to finish 13th out of 19 athletes in a very strong field. Even had Suriya matched the national record of 31:50:47 seconds, she would still have finished outside the podium. Gold went to Stella Chesang at 31:45:30 seconds while silver and bronze were claimed by Stacy Ndiwa and Mercyline Chelangat at 31: 46:36 seconds and 31:48:41 seconds respectively.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/18-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/anas-scripts-history-at-cwg-2018/,Athletics

07 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). All eyes will be on Neeraj Chopra ahead of the athletics competitions of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. No Indian athlete has ever won a gold in the javelin throw at the Games, but the 20-year-old from the village of Khandra in Haryana’s Panipat district might well break that trend. Chopra, who has a personal best of 86.48m, is coming into the Games with a season’s best of 85.94m. That throw is the best amongst Commonwealth Games this season. Also in Chopra’s favour is the fact that former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott is skipping the games while 2016 Olympic silver medalist Julius Yego of Kenya has been woefully out of form.

Should Chopra win gold, it would be only the fifth ever for India at the games. Only Milkha Singh (440 yards, 1958), women’s 4x400m (2010), Krishna Poonia (women’s discus, 2010) and Vikas Gowda (men’s discus, 2014) have won gold previously.

Chopra is one of several medal winning prospects for the Indian team. Competing in what she says will be her final Commonwealth Games, Seema Punia will be looking to end her journey on a high. The 34-year-old who has won two silver and a bronze medal so far will look to go all out this time around.

Triple jumper Arpinder Singh, who won a bronze medal at the 2014 Games, is also bidding to improve the colour of his prize this time around. “I think gold will go for 17m and I feel I can do it,” said Arpinder, the second best jumper among Commonwealth athletes this season with his 16.61 at the Federation Cup.

Also amongst India’s brightest prospects will be 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. The student of Kansas State University, broke his own national record of 2.26m this year with a jump of 2.28m at the Federation Cup this year. That leap was the best amongst Commonwealth Games athletes this year and he is expecting to improve on that performance at the gold coast games. Tejaswin is one of a new generation of athletes who are making massive strides. 18-year-old Hima Das, who will be competing in the individual 400m as well as the relay and 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be competing in the men’s 400m relay

India could even win their first medal on the opening day of the competition itself in the women’s 20km race walk. Race walker B Soumya set a new national record in the women’s 20km walk. Her time of 1.31.28 seconds is the third best by a Commonwealth athlete this season. India’s athletics campaign at the Games will begin with Men’s 20km walk featuring national record holder Irfan KT and Manish Rawat.

With several Indians up amongst the medal winning bracket, coaches are optimistic about the competition. “We are expecting five to six medals this time but don’t ask me what colour they will be,” deputy chief National coach Radhakrishnan Nair said. “And yes, in terms of number of medals, this promises to be our best ever outside India.”",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/16-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indias-athletics-campaign-begins-tomorrow-at-cwg-2018/,Athletics

"Ayyasamy sets National Record, Arpinder qualifies in triple jump for CWG","March 8, 2018","AFI Media
08 March 2018

Patiala. Dharun Ayyasamy of Tamil Nadu delivered the performance of his career as he shattered the 11-year old national record in the men’s 400m hurdles at the Run Adam Federation Cup at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Thursday.

Ayyasamy, who was part of the Indian 4x400m relay team at the Rio Olympics, crossed the finish line in the hurdles event in 49.45 seconds to erase the old mark of 49.51 seconds set by Joseph Abraham in Osaka in 2007.

The time Ayyasamy clocked was immediately significant for it was matched the qualifying guidelines of 49.45 seconds set by the AFI to determine the Indian team for the Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast.

Ayyasamy’s performance was all the more impressive for it came with the athlete still recovering from a serious illness. “I am really happy with the result,” Ayyasamy said after the win. “I was suffering from typhoid till ten days before of IGP. But i have worked hard with my coach to recover and train. It is a very good feeling to break national record and qualify for CWG,” he said. Ayyasamy finished ahead of statemates T Santosh Kumar (50.14seconds) and M Ramachandran (51.61 seconds).

Arpinder Singh, earned the right to improve on the bronze medal he won in the triple jump at the Glasgow Games in 2014 by clearing 16.61m to finish 1 cm above the qualifying guidelines of 16.60m set by the AFI. Arpinder was in danger of finishing outside the qualification guidelines but managed to find the mark in his fifth jump which was also his final legal jump of the competition.

Hima Das of Assam, who had already qualified in the women’s 400m race earlier, blitzed the field in the 200m event winning in a credible time of 23.37seconds which was just.07 seconds shy of the meet record of 23.30 set by PT Usha in 1998. Although Das also missed the CWG qualifying guidelines of 22.60 seconds, it was a credible performance by the 18 year old who finished more than a second clear of second place PJ Sneha (24.47 seconds).

Another strong performance that fell short of the CWG qualifying guidelines came in the 1500m through Jinson Johnson. Johnson clocked 3.39:69 seconds that was just .19 seconds shy of the qualifying guidelines of3:39:50 seconds. Johnsons mark was also a new meet record, erasing the old mark of 3:41:12 seconds recorded 11 years ago by Chatholi Hamza. Johnson finished ahead of Manjit Singh and Bir Singh who clocked 3:42:24 seconds and 3:42:28 seconds respectively.

Neeraj smashes meet record with his second best throw of career,"March 6, 2018","AFI Media
06 March 2018

Patiala. Neeraj Chopra reemphasized his position as the best javelin thrower in the country even as he won a gold medal at the Run Adam Federation Cup Senior National Athletics Championships 2018 by setting a new meet record.

In his final throw of the competition, Chopra threw the spear 85.94m, erasing the old mark of 85.63m, recorded at the same venue last year. Chopra who had already matched the AFI’s qualifying guidelines of 81.80m at the Indian Grand Prix last month, recorded what was the second best performance of his career and the best throw ever recorded on Indian soil. “Although I had already qualified for the CWG, I wanted to make a mark at the Federation Cup. That is why I was trying so hard. I will look to improve on this at the Commonwealth Games,” Neeraj said.

While Chopra had already qualified for the CWG, the Federation Cup was meant as the final opportunity for athletes to book their spots in the Indian squad. Two athletes made the most of the opportunity.

Hima Das, who turned 18 last month is primarily a 100 and 200m runner and was in fine form in the latter having won gold at the Asian Games Test event. However she was competing in the 400m and stunned the Federation Cup field in what was her debut competition in the quarter mile. Das clocked 51.97m to finish inside the CWG qualifying guidelines of 52 seconds set by the Athletics Federation of India. “I was expecting to do around 52 seconds. So when I saw that I was able to go inside 52 seconds I was very happy. I was not sure how I would run the 400m but I was able to run without any difficulty,” Das said after finishing more than a second ahead of second place GK Vijaykumari who clocked 53.03 seconds.

Shot putter Tejinder Pal Toor was the other athlete to exceed the AFI’s qualifying guidelines. Toor, who won a silver at the Asian Indoor games in January, needed just one throw to better the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 20.20m, by hurling the iron sphere 20.24m. For Toor, it was a satisfying return to the ground on which he had thrown a personal best of 20.40m last season. Back then Toor had been in the race to qualify for the 2017 World Championships but had fallen short by 10 centimetres. Despite his performance on Tuesday, Toor was not satisfied with his performance. “My goal was to throw over 21 meters. I could not do it here but I will try to do it in the Commonwealth Games,” he said.

There were other strong performances on the day too, most impressive of which was long jumper M Sreeshankar, who leaped into the junior record books with a jump of 7.99m. Although the 18-year-old Sreeshankar took the gold medal, he fell just 1 cm short of the AFI qualifying standard mark of 8.00m set for his event.

Although he fell short of the qualifying guideline of 10.16m, Siva Kumar of Tamil Nadu, marked himself as a sprinter to watch out for as he stunned a 100m field that included National Record holder Amiya Mallick and Asian Indoor bronze medalist Elakkiya Dasan to win a maiden national gold medal with a time of 10.43 seconds. Elakkiya Dasan was second with 10.56 seconds while Sanjeet of Haryana was third with a time of 10.59 seconds.

Neeraj Chopra makes winning return at Indian Grand Prix,"February 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 February 2018

Patiala. Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra made a return to domestic competition with a strong performances to claim gold at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1. Chopra threw the spear a distance of 82.88m at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday to finish ahead of Vipin Kasana who managed a best throw of 80.04m. Amit Kumar took bronze with a best of 77.33m. It was a much anticipated result for Chopra, who was taking part in his first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

Chopra was not the only athlete to impress though. Shot Putter Tajinder Pal Toor claimed gold in the men’s shot put with a best throw of 19.95m. While Tajinder has a personal best of 20.40m, recorded at the same venue in June last year, his throw on Tuesday was credible coming as early as it did in the season. Toor, improved on 19.77m he threw to claim a silver at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January this year. Toor finished ahead of Naveen Chikkara who threw the put 19.08m while the bronze went to Paramjeet Singh who only managed 16.74m.

Two athletes would also join Chopra in meeting the AFI qualifying guidelines for the Commonwealth Games. Long jumper Nayana James and women’s discus thrower Navjeet Dhillon also managed to meet the minimum requirement.

James, carried on from the form that saw her winning silver at the Asian Indoor Championships by claiming gold in Patiala with a best jump of 6.47m. She finished ahead of Nina Pinto who cleared 6.41m. Purnima Hembram also managed to step on the podium with a best effort of 5.99m.

Former World Junior bronze medalist Navjeet Dhillon too delivered a personal best effort of 59.18m to inch past the AFI qualifying guidelines of 59m.

Also coming close to the qualifying guideline was triple jumper Rakesh Babu. The Kerala jumper managed a best of 16.59m on Tuesday coming a centimeter short of the AFI standard of 16.60m. Babu’s effort however was good enough to win gold, edging Commonwealth bronze medalist Arpinder Singh who managed a best of 16.45m. National record holder Renjith Maheshwary finished third with a jump of 16.09m.

Amongst the other bright performers of the day were MP Jabir who claimed the 400m hurdles gold with a time of 50.60seconds, just shy of his personal best of 50.22m. Jabir finished ahead of Santhosh Kumar (50.85 seconds) and Binu Jose (52.77seconds). Upcoming triple jumper Renu produced a mini upset on the day. Renu jump of 13.26m was enough to pip the 13.08m effort of NV Sheena, a silver medalist at last months Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran. 18-year-old Hima Das too gave a strong account of herself with a personal best timing of 11.74 seconds in the women’s 100m race. Das took silver behind gold medalist Dutee Chand who clocked 11.57 seconds.

RUN ADAM IGP PREVIEW,"February 26, 2018","Athletics season starts with Run Adam IGP in Patiala on Tuesday

AFI Media
26 February 2018

Patiala: Javelin throw national record holder Neeraj Chopra will be the star performer in action at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1 (Run Adam IGP) to be held in the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday. Chopra though will only be one of a total of 129 competitors for whom the prestigious one day event essentially marks the beginning of the Indian domestic calendar.

For the athletes, the eventual goal is to match the qualifying standards for the Commonwealth Games. While the Run Adam IGP will likely serve as a warm up event ahead of the Federation Cup in early March, the high quality of the field could well spring up a few surprises.

For Chopra the tournament will be a first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

While this is the first domestic tournament, several of the athletes are in strong form, having competed in prior international events. 100m sprinter Elakiya Dasan is fresh off a bronze medal at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January and subsequently another bronze at the Asian Games Test event in Jakarta. In the latter event he had clocked 10.31 seconds which is the fastest time run by an Indian outside India. He will be challenged by Amiya Mallick who holds the national record in the 100m of 10.26 seconds. Mallick, who has been training in the USA for the past one month has set his target as qualifying for the Commonwealth Games.

Other athletes to watch out for are long jumper Nayana James, who claimed a silver medal at the Asian Indoor Championships and a bronze at the Asian Championship, shot putter Tejinder Pal Toor who won a silver at Bhubaneshwar and national record holder and defending Asian quarter mile champion Mohammad Anas.

Amongst the youngsters to keep an eye on is 18-year-old Hima Das who clocked an impressive personal best of 23.59 seconds in the women’s 200m at the Asian Games. The time was the second fastest by a U-20 athlete this year. While Das will only be running in the 100m in Patiala, she would be keen to make a mark at that event too.

Due to fewer entries in women’s shot put and discus throw and men’s high jump, these events have been dropped from the competition.

"National Youth: Seema, Gurindervir post national marks","April 21, 2017","National Youth Athletics: Seema, Gurindervir post national marks

Hyderabad – 21 April 2017:

The opening day of 14th National Youth Athletics championships, which commenced at G.M.C. Balayogi Stadium in Gachibowli here, witnessed national youth records being bettered in two events.

When the first day’s proceedings unfolded in the morning Seema, Himachal Pradesh’s petite distance runner from Dharamsala, erased Kerala girl Anumol Thampi’s meet and national mark of 10:00.22 with a noteworthy 9 minutes 56.25 seconds clocking. Maharashtra’s Poonam Sonune (10:02.14) and U.P. girl Amrita Patel (10:04.85) clinched the other two medals.

Delhi lad Raj Shekhar, who won the boys’ race with a timing of 8:42.93, missed the world youth qualifying mark (8:42.00) narrowly.

In the evening, Punjab sprinter Gurindervir Singh provided a stunner by taking off the national record in boys’ 100m final clocking 10.74 secs.  His time improved Praveen Muthukumaran’s six year old mark by just 1/100th of a second.  Delhi’s Ch. Palender Kumar pushed him so hard and finished second with another noteworthy 10.80s.

Gurvindervir equaled the winning time of Huang Yonglian in Chinese youth nationals that ended in Nanchang on Thursday and that revealed his medal ambitions in the forthcoming Asian Youth Championships at Bangkok, Thailand, next month.

As expected Bengal’s Rajashree Prasad won the girls’ 100m in 12.33 secs.  Earlier this year Rajshree clocked 12.17 secs to win the national school games title at Pune.

Haryana throwers ruled the day with best performances, starting with Haryana discus thrower Abhay Gupta in the morning.  Gupta hurled the disc to a stupendous 58.80m that upsets teammate and favourite Sahil Silwal (53.74m) to sidelines.  In shot put Mohit heaved the iron ball to 19.01m for the top spot in the absence of national youth record-holder Dipender Dabas (20.63m) who is also the event leader in Asian youth rankings last season.

Tamil Nadu javelin thrower N. Hemamalini unleashed the spear to 44.03m to retain the numero uno position.  However it is lesser than her best of 45.26m from the last season.  In long jump, her teammate R. Punitha took the top spot with a modest 5.75m.

Tanya Chaudhary and Mansi Negi shift focus on U20 athletes with National marks,"November 13, 2022","Guwahati, November 13: Tanya Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) and Mansi Negi (Uttarakhand) forced the attention to be shifted to the under-20 athletes with National Record performances in the women’s Hammer Throw and 10000m Race Walk in the 37th AFI National Junior Athletics Championships in the Athletics Stadium at the SAI Regional Centre here today.

On the first two days, athletes from the younger age groups were the ones who broke National records.

Tanya Chaudhary improved her own U20 National records from 57.04, set in Nadiad earlier this year to 58.30m today. She first broke the meet mark of 50.74m set by Anisha Dahiya in Mangalagiri in 2019 on her second visit to the circle with a 52.21m effort. She followed that up with her maiden throw past the 58m mark.

In the women’s U20 10000m Race Walk, Mansi Negi clocked 47 minutes 30.94 seconds to take ownership of the U20 National and Meet records. Munita Prajapati had pegged both records at 47:53.58 at the Sarusajai Stadium here last year. In fact, Haryana’s Rachana (49:14.88) and Maharashtra’s Sejal Anil Singh (49:29.31) also went past the earlier mark.

Jyothi Yarraji stands tall as first Indian woman Hurdler to break 13-second barrier,"October 17, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 17: Jyothi Yarraji (Railways) made history by becoming the first Indian woman to clock a legal sub-13 second time for 100m Hurdles at the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today.

The 23-year-old cruised to victory in 12.82 seconds and, with the wind gauge reading 0.9m/s, she could not be denied that honour a second time. She had won the National Games in IIT Gandhinagar in a time of 12.79 seconds but was supported by wind that exceeded the permissible limit.

Jyothi Yarraji was unstoppable tonight. She had already owned the meet mark with 13.18 seconds in the heats, bettering the record of 13.38 seconds set by Anuradha Biswal in Chennai 20 years ago. In the final, she hit the front by the time the seven athletes got to the second hurdle and was a comfortable winner.

The Railways star, who hails from Andhra Pradesh and trains in Bhubaneswar, capped a fine season, with a fumble only at the National Inter-State Championships in Chennai in June. She thus became the second fastest Asian in the event this year and earned a place just outside the continent’s all-time Top 10 list.

It was the third time this year that she rewrote the National record. She broke Anuradha Biswal mark of 13.38 set in 2002 with 13.11 in Loughborough University on May 22. Four days later, she raised the bar to 13.04 seconds in Vught, Netherlands. Earlier, had a 13.09-second effort in the Federation Cup in Kozhikode but was denied by excessive wind speed.

Late on Sunday evening, Parshant Singh Kanhiya (Railways) claimed the men’s Pole Vault meet record when he cleared 5.15m. S Siva, who broke his own National record in the recent National Games, cleared 5.00m to concede a handsome victory for Parshant Singh Kanhiya.

Harmilan Bains steals Sprinters’ Thunder with National Record in 1500m,"September 16, 2021","AFI Media

Warangal, September 16: Punjab’s metric miler Harmilan Kaur Bains stole the thunder from the sprinters by breaking Sunita Rani’s long-standing National Record on the second day of the 60th National Open Athletics Championships in the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Hanamkonda here on Thursday.

The 23-year-old start-to-finish specialist cruised home in 4:05.39 to erase the mark set by Sunita Rani at 4:06.03 in the Asian Games in Busan in 2002. She also shattered OP Jaisha’s Meet Record of 4:11.83 set in Delhi in 2006. Delhi’s KM Chanda gamely shadowed Harmilan Bains until the Punjab runner sped away at the bell to win by a sizable margin.

Harmilan Bains, undefeated in eight national-level 1500m races since January 2020, has shown rapid progress, improving from 4:14.68 in the Khelo India University Games in Bhubaneshwar last year to 4:08.70 and 4:08.27 in the Federation Cup (March 16) and Indian Grand Prix 4 (June 21) respectively in Patiala. On Thursday, she capped it with a National mark..

It needed such a strong effort to push a couple of good sprint events to the shade. Naresh Kumar (Andhra Pradesh) and Delhi’s Tarandeep Kaur took the honours as the fastest male and female athlete of the meet by winning the 100m dash

Naresh Kumar’s 10.30 seconds win came with the second fastest time by an Indian in 100m this year behind Gurindervir Singh’s 10.27 seconds in Patiala on June 26. It also gave the 23-year-old from Guntur a place among the five fastest sprinters in Indian history. Quite inevitably, it gave him the Meet Record, improving on Anil Kumar’s 10.37 seconds set in 2001.

The race produced personal bests for Assam’s Amlan Borgohain and Harjit Singh (Services) with times of 10.34 seconds for both, a photo finish separating them by six-thousandths of a second to secure the silver medal for the former. To their credit, the trio was able to script great runs despite a couple of false starts by Services’ KS Pranav and Satnam Singh.

Delhi teenager Taranjeet Kaur, who was knocked down by a car and broke a collar bone just over two years ago, claimed the title of the fastest woman of the meet with a blazing run in a personal best time of 11.50 seconds to leave the seasoned Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) in her wake. Taranjeet Kaur knocked two-tenths of a second from her previous best of 11.70 clocked in winning the Federation Cup Junior (U20) title in Bhopal on January 25 this year.

The men’s 1500m race saw an upset of sorts as little-known Parvej Khan (Haryana) stunned the two-time Asian Athletics Championships medalist Ajay Kumar Saroj (Railways) tasted his first defeat at the National level since August 20, 2019. Parvej Khan ensured that he kept pace with Ajay Kumar Saroj at the bell and took over with 300m left, opening up a good lead.

Yaman Deep Sharma (Rajasthan) emerged the best all-rounder with a 55-point victory over Usaid Khan (Services), riding on his 182-point lead earned on the first day on Wednesday through the Long Jump, High Jump and 400m sprint. Hard as Usaid Khan tried through 110m Hurdles and Javelin Throw on Thursday, there was no stopping Yaman Deep Sharma.

Hepathlete Swapna Barman (Railways) won the women’s High Jump competition while Sahil Silwal (Haryana) showed that he could be the Javelin Thrower to watch in the future as he won the men’s event with a final throw of 77.79m that saw him catapult from the fourth spot to the top of the podium.

"Abhishek Paul posts maiden 5000m victory, Parul doubles joy for Railways","September 15, 2021","AFI Media

Warangal, September 15: Railways’ runners Abhishek Pal and Parul Chaudhary won the men and women’s 5000m titles respectively while Tamil Nadu’s Pavithra Venkatesh forced two Railways’ Pole Vaulters to settle for minor medals on the opening day of the 60th National Open Athletics Championships at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.

With the Federation Cup 5000m winner Amit Jangir not starting on Wednesday, the race was always going to be a contest between Railways’ 24-year-old Abhishek Paul and the Services trio. He used smart race tactics to emerge a winner for the first time in a 5000m race in a National competition.

Abhishek Pal was content to run most of the race in third place, shifting gears with 300m left. His powerful strides brooked no response from the erstwhile leader Dharmender. Kartik Kumar, who won the 5000m in the Inter-State Championships in June, tried to use the Railways runner’s pace but realised that Ajay Kumar had enough energy left to claim the bronze medal.

Parul Chaudhary also played the waiting game, settling behind leader Komal Chandrakant Jagdale for a large part of the race and striding ahead with just over 250m left in the 12-and-a-half-lap event. The 22-year-old Maharashtra runner, who did not find the speed to keep Parul Chaudhary at bay or to challenge her on the home stretch, took silver with a personal best time.

Another Maharashtra runner, Sanjivani Babar Jadhav, taking only her third start in a national-level long distance race, was in the mix till the halfway stage but found it tough to keep pace with the two leaders and claimed the bronze medal well ahead of Chinta Yadav, the second runner in Railways colours.

In the women’s Pole Vault, Tamil Nadu’s Pavithra Venkatesh topped the contest, clearing the bar at 3.90m while Railways’ Mariya Jaison and Krishna Rachan took silver and bronze with clearances at 3.80m and 3.70m. Rosy Meena Paulraj (Tamil Nadu) missed out on the bronze on countback.

Services’ Muhammed Ajmal, stepping up from the shorter sprints to the quartermile, clocked 47.08 seconds to be the fastest of the eight qualifiers for the final. Ayush Dabas (Haryana) won his heats with a time of 47.24. In the absence of many familiar names, seven of the men’s 400m qualifiers for the final were credited with sub-48 seconds efforts.

Andhra Pradesh’s Dandi Jyothika Sri was the fastest qualifier for the women’s 400m final, clocking 54.83 seconds. Haryana’s Kavita, competing on the national stage after a gap, was the second fastest with 55.14 seconds on day when Olympian V Revathi (Railways) did not start and familiar names like Summy (Haryana) and Soniya Baishya (Railways) did not qualify.

VK Elakkiadasan (Railways) and K Naresh Kumar (Andhra Pradesh) were the fastest qualifiers for the men’s 100m finals winning their heats in 10.52 seconds and 10.54 seconds respectively. Harjit Singh (Services) and Amlan Borgohain (Assam) were the other sprinters who dipped in under 10.60 seconds on their way to the final.

In the women’s 100m heats, Delhi’s Taranjeet Kaur broke the beam in 11.70 seconds, beating Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) and Himashree Roy (Railways) to the second and third places. In the other heats, Nithya Gandhe (Telangana) got home in 11.90 seconds to beat the fancied C Kanimozhi (Railways) to second place.

The results (finals):

National Open could be springboard for many hoping to don India colours next year,"September 14, 2021","AFI Media

 Warangal, September 14: The season-ending National Open Athletics Championships, the 11th national-level track and field competition this year, is expected to be springboard from which many fresh faces will be launched in the absence of those who competed for India in the Olympic Games in Tokyo earlier this year.

With an eye on the championship, Railways has entered the largest contingent of 87 athletes, including 43 women, while Services’ 57-member all-male squad is the second largest ahead of All India Police which will field 50 athletes, including 24 women in the five-day competition in the spanking new Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Hanamkonda here.

It is the second National competition in Warangal in two years, having hosted the National Cross-Country Championships in January 2020. The Telangana Athletics Association and the district administration of Warangal have left no stone unturned to ensure that the competition is held according to the Athletics Federation of India SOP and for Covid-19 protocols.

A number of athletes will be looking to make a mark while most of those who competed in the Olympic Games have chosen to rest and recover. The 2018 Asian Games Triple Jump gold medallist Arpinder Singh could be the biggest draw in the men’s events. But VK Elakkiadasan and Shanmuga Srinivas Nalubothu, India’s fastest 200m sprinter this year, battle in the half-lapper can be very interesting.

Muhammed Anees Yahiya and Yugant Shekhar Singh’s rivalry at the Long Jump pit will be worth tracking. In the absence of teen sensation World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh, the likes of Priyanka Kerketta, Sherin Abdul Gafoor and Nandini Agasara can make the women’s Long Jump competition very intense.  Similarly, in the women’s Hammer Throw, long-standing rivals Manju Bala and Sarita R Singh can also produce a keen contest.

Summy Kaliravan, part of the mixed relay squad that won a 4x400m medal in the World U20 Championships, may be up against Olympian V Revathi. Race Walker Bhawna Jat, who also competed in Tokyo2020, Discus Thrower Navjeet Kaur Dhillon and sprinters Archana Suseendran, Himashree Roy and C Kanimozhi are some familiar names.

There will be considerable attention on the 15-year-old High Jumper Pavana Nagaraj, who has a personal best of 1.73m, but it will be Tripura sprinter Priyanka Bhowmick who will claim the credit of being the youngest athlete in the competition at just 14 years of age.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/75X420.png,https://indianathletics.in/preview-60th-national-open-athletics-championships-2021-warangal/,Athletics
"Avinash Sable, Neeraj Chopra and Tajinderpal Toor give India reason for cheer","March 17, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 17: Avinash Sable (Maharashtra) paid the best possible tribute to the late coach Nikolai Snesarev posting a new National Record time of 8 minutes 20.20 seconds as he won the men’s 3000m Steeplechase on the third day of the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Wednesday.

Along with javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, Sable gave India much reason for cheer. Neeraj Chopra broke his own meet record while Tajinderpal Toor had a superb series of throws.

Sable, who set the earlier National mark at 8:21.37 in the World Championships in Doha on October 4, 2019, broke free of the pack after a lap and a half and raced the clock. Having already secured Olympic qualification, the 26-year-old was a picture of determination and confidence as he chased his target time – almost as if to honour the late Belarussian coach.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra sustained his fine run of form with a massive throw over 87.80m on his final attempt which secured him a new meet record. Having raised the National record to 88.07m in the Indian Grand Prix III here on March 5, he showed a hunger for consistency and desire to embrace consistency rather than rest on his oars.

Earlier, 26-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) uncorked a series of big throws as he sought to meet the Olympic qualifying mark of 21.10m. Opening with a throw of 19.99m, the strapping left-hander went past the 20m mark on each of his four other legal throws, recording 20.20, 20.17, 20.58 and 20.47 with a foul on his fourth try.

The World No. 24 was looking to join 24 others who have achieved the Olympic entry standard. At the moment, he is third on the list of eight who can qualify on the basis of their world ranking. The final two attempts on Wednesday evening showed that he is getting better outcomes for his sustained efforts.

Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) played the waiting to game to perfection, letting Komal Jagdale (Maharashtra) set the pace but staying on her heels through the women’s 3000m Steeplechase only to sprint away in the final 200m to a secure comfortable win in the end. She was also superior at the water jumps where Komal Jagdale lost some precious time.

Priyanka Kerketta (Jharkhand) came up with a final effort of 6.10m to leapfrog to gold medal past Rintu Mathew (Kerala) and Sherin Abdul Gafoor (Tamil Nadu), who both had best efforts of 6.07m each. Priyanka Kerketta, 22, was lying in the fourth spot with a best of 6.01m but her final jump pushed Telangana’s Agasara Nandini out of the medal bracket.

Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) won the fastest of three men’s 800m semifinals, clocking 1:50.81 ahead of Krishan Kumar (Haryana) and Anu Kumar (Uttarakhand) but the with Asian Games gold medalist Manjit Singh (Haryana) in the fray, the final could see a faster time.

The women’s two-lap final will pit MR Poovamma against Delhi’s Chanda and Shalu Chaudhary as well as Lili Das (West Bengal) and Haryana’s Rachna.

On Tuesday, a few days shy of his 19th birthday, Usaid Khan (Uttar Pradesh) won the tough Decathlon with 6890 points. He built a total of 3572 points on the first day with good performances in the 100m and 400m sprints to insure against the strong second day challenge of Navjor Singh (Punjab). By improving his throwing, Usaid Khan can aspire to rise as an Asian Games prospect.

Olympic hopefuls in athletics return to competition after 15 months,"February 18, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, February 18: Dutee Chand breezed to 100m victory in 11.51 seconds and hogged the limelight in the Indian Grand Prix I Athletics at the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports here on Thursday. It was the first national-level track and field for seniors meet since the National Open Athletics Championships in Ranchi in October 2019.

With the cream of Indian athletics gearing up for the AFI Federation Cup to be held here next month, the Grand Prix I showed that the athletes were in good fettle. A number of personal bests was evidence of the shape that the athletes have kept themselves in, mindful of the fact that in the Olympic year they would use such a meet as part of their preparation for the task ahead.

Kerala’s Muhammad Anas Yahiya, the leading 400m runner in the country, took part in the 100m and finished a creditable second in 10.70 seconds, two-hundredths of a second behind Krishnakumar Satish Rane (Maharashtra). Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha) won the slower B Race in 10.89 seconds to take the third place overall.

S Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) showed a good turn of speed in the men’s 200m, winning the B race in 21.40 seconds to edge out Shashank Shinde (Chhattisgarh) as the fastest over the distance on Thursday. Shashank Shinde has stopped the clock at 22.21 seconds in the A race after Noah Nirmal Tom (Kerala) pulled up injured inside the first 25m.

In the women’s 200m, Anjali Devi (Haryana) ran out a comfortable winner against sprinter Kaveri Laxmana Gouda Patil (Karnataka) and fellow quarter-mile specialist Subha Venkatesan (Tamil Nadu). While Anjali’s time of 23.57 seconds was a shade below her best of 23.44 seconds, Kaveri Patil (24.45) and Subha Venkatesan (24.59) produces personal bests.

Long jumper Yugant Singh (Uttar Pradesh) marked his return to competitive athletics after four years with a personal best leap of 7.62m to edge out Haryana’s Sahil Mahabali who had taken the lead after two rounds with a 7.59m effort. The 23-yer-old Yugant Singh’s previous best was 7.58m back in the National Open Championship in September 2015.

MR Poovamma (Karnataka) did well to beat fellow National camper Kiran Pahal (Haryana) by more than a second in the women’s 400m. The coaching staff could be pleased with 30-year-old Poovamma’s time today. For, through the year 2019, she had only four faster races than the 53.45 seconds she clocked today.

Maheshwari scripts National record effort in 3000mSteeplechase,"November 6, 2019","Guntur, November 6: Telangana’s G Maheshwari scripted the sole National record on the final day of the 35th National Junior Athletics Championships at the Acharya Nagarjuna University campus here on Tuesday, winning the girls under-20 3000m steeplechase crown with a time of 10:34.10 that was 12.71 seconds faster than her previous best in the event.

 

Running a race of her own, with the competitors fighting for the second spot, Maheshwari easily secured the National Record that was pegged at 10:53.91 by Nandini Gupta in Lucknow in 2017 and the Meet Record that stood at 10:55.54 in Khushboo Gupta’s name since the Mangalagiri meet in 2017.

 

The host State’s Nalubothu Shanmuga Srinivas stunned the boys under-18 200m field with a blistering run. His time of 21.34 seconds is a Meet Record, clipping 0.16 seconds off the time set by Nisar Ahmed in Ranchi last year. Karnataka’s VA Shashikanth, who was only a hundredth’s of the winning time had to settle for the runner-up spot like he had in the 100m on November 3. For the record, Nalubothu Shanmuga Srinivas and Shashikanth were faster than the boys under-20 200m winner, Abhin V Devadiga (Karnataka).

 

The day’s other Meet Record came from Uttarakhand’s Ankita in the 1500m in the girls under-18 division. On a day when National Record holder Tai Hiraman Bamhane (Maharashtra) finished a distant third, Ankita was pushed by Haryana’s Pooja. She finished in 4:28.20 to erase Lili Das’s name from the record books. Lili Das had timed 4:35.40 in Ranchi in 2015.

 

Pratiksha Patel (Uttar Pradesh) came up with a new meet record in girls under-16 Javelin Throw with a 43.08m effort, breaking the old mark of 41.24 set by Jyoti in 2017); Ramyashree Jain (Karnataka) also went past Jyoti’s mark in taking second place with 41.33m in a fine duel with Pratiksha Patel.

 

Among the more familiar names, boys under-20 triple jumper Praveen Chithravel (Tamil Nadu) needed to bring off his best off the final jump to win gold and redeem himself. Lying third with a best effort of 15.38 after five rounds, he produced a jump of 15.85m to beat Gailey Venister (Andhra Pradesh) and Aravinth E (Tamil Nadu) to the title.

"Avinash Sable, Sreeshankar come up with heart-warming performances on Final Day","August 30, 2019","Lucknow, August 30: Steeplechaser Avinash Sable (Maharashtra) and long jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) warmed up for the IAAF World Athletics Championships with good performances on the closing day of the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Friday.

The 24-year-old Avinash Sable, placed 25th on the IAAF World Rankings, ran at a comfortable pace and yet claimed the meet record with ease, clocking 8:33.19. He could have challenged his own National record (8:28.94) but the humidity was of little help, despite his event being scheduled as the last on the track.

Sreesankar hit sand at 7.83m on his second jump and raised hopes that he would script an 8-metre jump here. The 20-year-old wound himself up for a massive effort when he returned to the runway, showcasing raw energy and speed as he reached the take-off board and landed near that desired mark, but he had disappointingly over-stepped by a little bit to cause the red flag to be raised.

On a day when India’s premier 4x400m men’s team endured disappointment, owing to Alex A Antony stepping out with a muscle pull 200m into the third leg, Tamil Nadu’s women’s sprint quartet held its own by setting the other meet record. Dhana Lakshmi, R Nithya Ramraj, V Revathi and Archana Suseendran combined to finish the 4x100m relay in 45.69 seconds, improving on the 45.96 set by the Kerala team in 1997.

Dutee Chand (Odisha) tried gamely but could not meet the IAAF World Championships qualifying standard in the women’s 100m. She blazed her way to win in 11.38 seconds, 0.14 seconds slower than the target time. Vidya Sagar (Karnataka) emerged the fastest male athlete of the championships edging out Haryana youngster Nuzrat Ali by seven-hundredths of a second.

The gangling Parul Chaudhary outsprinted Sudha Singh on the final lap of the women’s 3000m steeplechase that often saw the lead being exchanged. Her victory helped her completed a double, having won gold in the 5000m on the opening day. Lili Das had done something similar, settling in PU Chitra’s slipstream but sprinting ahead over the final 50m of the women’s 1500m.

The results (all finals):

Javelin thrower Sanjana defends junior Federation Cup title,"April 20, 2018","20 April 2018
AFI Media

Coimbatore (TN). Under18 National champion Ankit of Haryana, came close to setting a meet record during his gold medal winning run in the men’s U20 1500m race at the 16th Federation Cup National Junior Athletics Championships in Coimbatore on Firday. Ankit, clocked 3:51.81 seconds to fall just short of the old meet record of 3:51:16 seconds set by Shashi Bhushan Singh in 2015. Ankit though was well clear of the field, finishing well ahead of Ajit Kumar of Gujarat, who clocked 3:53:21 seconds to take silver. Bronze went to Kerala’s Abhinath Sundaresan, who finished with a time of 3:53:23 seconds. Sundaresan would be disappointed by the performance considering he is the reigning national champion in the event.

Defending champion – Sanjana Choudhary in the U20 women’s javelin throw — had better fortune. Choudhary, who claimed gold in the 2017 edition in Lucknow, took the same title with ease at Coimbatore. Choudhary threw the spear a distance of 46.97m to finish ahead of Hemamalini Neelakandan of Tamil Nadu who had a best effort of 43.14m. Jyoti of Haryana, took the final place on the podium with an effort of 42.89m.

Kiran Baliyan claimed the women’s U20 shot put event with a throw of 15.23m. The throw, one of only two legal throws made by the athlete from UP, failed to come close to the national record of 15.89m set by Commonwealth bronze medallist Navjeet Dhillon, but it was still well clear of the efforts of statemate Anamika Das, who took silver with a throw of 13.83m. Kachnar Choudhary of Rajasthan took bronze with a throw of 13.52m.

3000m Junior National Champion Gupreet Singh too added a Federation Cup medal to his name. Gurpreet, who claimed the 3000m title in the U18 category, was competing in the U20 5000m race in Coimbatore. He won with a time of 14:46:51 seconds. He finished ahead of UP’s Ajay Kumar Bind and Maharashtra’s Dinesh Kumar, who clocked 14:53:65 seconds and 14:59:44 seconds respectively.

Making the step up to a higher age group would however be difficult for Seema of Himachal Pradesh. The athlete who had won the 3000m women’s U18 title at the Vijaywada Nationals in 2017, could only finish second best in the U20 category in the same event at the Federation Cup. She clocked 9:51:04 seconds to take silver behind Poonam Sonune of Maharashtra who clocked 9:50:61 seconds. Bronze went to Savita Pal of Assam, who finished a distant third with a time of 10:16:16 seconds.

Roji Patel was the only other gold medal winner on a day when four finals were washed out due to rain and bad light. The athlete from Assam won the women’s U20 10000m race walk event with a time of 51:44:52 seconds. She finished ahead of Manju Rani of Gujarat and Sneha of Haryana, who clocked 51:55:07 seconds and 52:08:13 seconds, respectively.",Hima Das,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Javelin-thrower-Sanjana-defends-junior-Federation-Cup-title.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/javelin-thrower-sanjana-defends-junior-federation-cup-title/,Athletics
Four sprinters cross national record mark in U16 boys’ 200m final,"November 20, 2017","November 20, Vijayawada (AP): There are events in Athletics where records are broken but rarely do we see four athletes breaking a record in one single event. This happened on the last day of the Coromandel- 33rd National Junior Athletics Championships 2017 in the final of the boys’ U16 200m dash at the Acharya Nagarjuna University athletics ground here today.

Delhi sprinter Nisar Ahmed grabbed the gold medal of the event and established a new national record of 21.73s by breaking previous record of 22.11s.

In U18 boys’ 200m race, Akshay Nain (Delhi) set a new meet record of 21.59s equalling previous record of 21.59s set by Jijin Vijayan of Kerala in 2011. In U20 boys’ 200 metres, Akshay Kumar of UP broke meet record of Mohit (Haryana, 21.35s) by his gold winning performance of 21.28sec.

Another glorious performance came in U18 boys’ 2000m steeplechase where five athletes crossed previous meet record with Raj Kumar (Delhi) winning gold in five minutes 51.90s breaking his own 2016 record of six minutes 02.69 seconds. Vikash (Haryana, silver) with the timing of 5:55.74, Vikas (Maharashtra, bronze) 5:57.45, Mohammed Noor (UP, fourth) 5:57.90 and Granwil (Kerala, fifth) 6:02.13 all crossed the previous meet record.

In girls’ U20 200m, Jisna Mathew (AFI) broke previous meet record of 24.28sec set by Nirupama in 2010 with a stellar performance of 24.24s while in girls’ U20 3000m steeplechase, Khushboo set new meet record of 10:55.54 breaking 11.04.80 record set by Parul Chaudhary in 2014.

In U20 boys’ 4X400m relay, Haryana set a new meet record of 3:11.03 displacing the decade old record of 3:14.13 set by Kerala in 2005.

Haryana with a total of 408 points finished as the Overall Champion of the championship while Uttar Pradesh shared the Boys Team Championship title with Haryana with 221pts. Kerala (230pts) won the Girls Team Championship title.

AFI Media

Patiala: Javelin thrower Anu Rani was the star performer of the the 21st Federation Cup National Senior Athletics Championships, throwing the spear 61.86m to break her own national record of 60.01m in the last event of the comeptition.

It was a day of double delight as four athletes took home their second gold of the tournament on Sunday. G Lakshmanan and his sister L Suriya added the 10000m crowns to the 5000m titles they had won on the first day of the competition. They were joined by Nayana James who claimed the women’s 100m hurdles gold to go along with her long jump title earlier in the competition. The highlight of the double act was Amoj Jacob, only 19, who completed a 400-800m double when he won men’s single lap race. Jacob, a student of New Delhi’s Khalsa college, ran a personal best time of 46.26m to claim the 400m men’s title. He edged Arokia Rajiv of Tamil Nadu who clocked 46.64m and Sachin Roby of Kerala, who took bronze, with a time of 46.87seconds.

Tamil Nadu’s Lakshmanan claimed the men’s 10000m gold with a time of 29:23.46seconds. He finished ahead of Kerala’s Gopi Thonakal who clocked 29:55.67seconds and KalidasHirave who took bronze for Maharashtra with a time of 29:57.94seconds. “It is my season’s best timing.

Sister L Suriya had earlier claimed the women’s crown with a time of 33.12.67 seconds. She finished ahead of Maharashtra’s Sanjivani Jadhav who clocked 33.15.77seconds while Delhi’s Meenu finished third in 34:17.11 seconds.

Suresh clocked 14.35seconds while Balamurugan claimed bronze with a time of 14.52 seconds. “Over the last few months it has been difficult for me because I have a full time job with the Income Tax department. So I have to balance my training along with my work which is hard,” said Kumar.

Dutee Chand and Amiya Mallick became the fastest men and women of the meet when they won the women and men’s 100m sprint on Sunday. Chand clocked 11.48seconds to exact revenge on Orissa statemateSrabani Nanda who had earlier beaten her in the 200m contest. Nanda finished second with a time of 11.57seconds.

"Dutee Chand’s National record, Amiya Malik’s return as winner highlights of second day","October 11, 2019","Dutee Chand’s National record, Amiya Malik’s return as winner highlights of second day

 

AFI Media

Ranchi, October 11: If Dutee Chand could have her way, she would have loved to have swapped the form and the times that she clocked over 100m in the 59th National Open Athletics Championships on Friday night a fortnight ago in the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha. The 23-year-old Odiya found consolation by wresting the National record in 11.22 seconds.

 

Dutee Chand’s time of 11.22 seconds in the semifinals finally gave her sole ownership of the National record. At the Asian Championships in Doha in April this year, she had equaledRachita Mistry’s 11.26-second effort that held sway since the year 2000. Dutee Chand clocked 11.25 seconds in the final on Friday, leaving Archana Suseendran and Himashree Roy in the wake.

 

Of course, Dutee Chand would have liked to come up with this performance in the World Athletics Championships last month. She was looking for a better time in Doha but managed 11.48 to place a disappointing seventh in her heats. A time of 11.22 seconds – or even 11.25 seconds in the heats – would have seen her secure a semifinal berth in Doha.

 

When she arrived in Ranchi, she was unsure of the time she would clock. “A couple of days ago, I had the wrong belief that my body was tired at the end of the season. I recovered well to be able to break the last national mark twice this evening,” she said after winning the final with a measure of comfort.

 

Her State-mate Amiya Kumar Malik, who has been waiting through the whole season and more to find his rhythm and that elusive gold medal, won the bragging rights as the fastest man in the National Open. He won the men’s 100m in 10.46 seconds, breaking the beam a hundredth of a second ahead of Malaysia’s Jonathan AnakNyepa.

 

The photo-finish cameras had to identify Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) as the winner of the bronze medal by a margin of 0.0044 seconds from his team-mate Harjit Singh. But it was the manner in which Amiya Malik stormed to the finish that caught everyone’s eye. For someone who had not gone under 10.50 seconds in a long while, he will cherish this drought-ending victory.

 

MP Jabir (AFI) rewrote the men’s 400m Hurdles meet record, winning the final in 49.41 seconds. He improved on the mark of 49.67 seconds set by AyyasamyDharun (Tamil Nadu) last year. Dharun himself, running only his third hurdles race since recovering from an injury, will be pleased that he clocked 49.50 seconds for the second place, leaving T Santhosh Kumar (Services) in the third place.

 

Earlier, in a close finish, Haryana’s Rahul Rohilla, 23, won the men’s 20m race walking ahead of the more seasoned K Ganapathi (AFI) and Sandeep Kumar (Services). The Group B winner of the event in the National Race Walking Championship in Chennai in February, he finished on top of a better field this time.

 

There was some positive news for long jumper M Sreeshankar who leapt to 7.93m to lead the 12 qualifiers for the final.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/day-2-article-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/dutee-chands-national-record-amiya-maliks-return-as-winner-highlights-of-second-day/,Athletics
"Hima Das, Muhammed Anas, Dutee Chand win silver medals for team India","August 28, 2018","AFI Media
26 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Hima Das added an Asian Games silver to her list of achievements this year after she finished the women’s 400 metres final in Jakarta in a time of 50.79 seconds.

It was another national record for the sprinter from Assam, who broke her previous record of 51 seconds that she had set in the semi-finals on Saturday. Das, who had won the junior World title in Tampere, Finland last month, was also competing at her maiden Asiad and also won her first major international medal at the senior level.

Nirmala Sheoran, who also participated in the final, came close to a medal by finishing fourth, in a time of 52.96 seconds.

Muhammed Anas, the national record holder in the 400 metres, also won silver in the men’s section as he clocked a time of 45.69 seconds. Anas, who won his Heat and his semi-final yesterday, ran a fast race to claim his first Asian Games medal.

Also in the final was Arokia Rajiv, bronze medal winner from Incheon in 2014. The Tamil Nadu sprinter finished 0.14 seconds behind the third-placed finisher in fourth, and will now look forward to the 4X400 metre relay.

Dutee Chand won India’s third athletics medal of the day when she bagged a silver in the women’s 100 metres. Chand ran a fast race to secure second place with a time of 11.32 seconds.

Earlier, she had qualified for the final by finishing third in semi-final one, with a time of 11.43 seconds. Chand is also India’s national record holder with a time of 11.24 seconds.

Govindan Lakshmanan had finished third in the men’s 10,000 metres but was later disqualified for having stepped outside the curb. Had he not been stripped of his bronze medal, it would have been India’s first in the event since Bangkok 1998.

Sreeshankar Murali finished in sixth place in the Men’s Long Jump competition. The 19-year old registered a best jump of 7.95 metres, and he was temporarily in third place before being taken over by other jumpers. It was also his first major international competition and he had earlier qualified for the final with a single jump of 7.83 metres, ensuring automatic qualification.

Santosh Kumar and Ayyasamy Dharun also ensured that they qualified for the finals of the 400 metres hurdles by finishing second in their respective semi-finals. Dharun, who is also the national record holder with a time of 49.45 seconds, was close to the record, clocking 49.55 seconds in the semi-finals.

Anu Raghavan in the morning had clocked 56.77 seconds in her 400 metres hurdles heats and qualified for the final, along with Jauna Murmu.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hima-Das-Muhammed-Anas-Dutee-Chand-win-silver-medals-for-team-India.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/hima-das-muhammed-anas-dutee-chand-win-silver-medals-for-team-india/,Athletics
"Ritik, Chanda, Shaili and Nivya serve notice of potential with National records","November 3, 2019","Guntur, November 3: Ritik Malik (Delhi), Shaili Singh (Karnataka), Chanda (Delhi) and Nivya Antony (Kerala) set new National records in the boys under-18 100m, girls U-16 long jump, girls under-20 1500m and girls under-20 pole vault respectively on the second day of the 35th National Junior Athletics Championships at the Acharya Nagarjuna University campus here on Sunday.

 

Ritik Malik’s sprint was quite the highlight of the proceedings as his time of 10.65 seconds broke the National and Meet Records held by Gurindervir Singh (10.69) since 2017 and Praveen Muthukumaran (10.75) since 2011 respectively. His pace did catch VA Shashikant (Karnataka) by surprise and relegated him to second place.

 

Chanda, who clocked 4:30.25 in finish fourth in the National Inter-State Championships in Lucknow and 4:19.94 in taking third place in the National Open in Ranchi last month, showed that she has potential to do better by displaying sound race tactics on Sunday. She raced the clock rather than be stuck in traffic, taking the lead from the start and running her own race.

Nivya Antony was in good form coming into the championships. She has achieved her previous best mark of 3.70m in the Kerala State Athletics Championships in Kozhikode in June this year and matched that performance in the K Joseph Memorial Inter-District Championships in Thiruvanthapuram in August. Shaili Singh improved her national and meet record in girls U-16 long jump to 6.15m. She held previous record of 5.14m which she created at same competition last year at Ranchi.

 

There were meet records for Lovepreet Singh (AFI-Punjab) and AT Daneshwari (Karnataka) respectively in the boys and girls under-20 100m races. Lavepreet Singh’s dash in 10.60 seconds was easily his personal best, improving on the 10.66 he clocked in the National Open Athletics Championships in Ranchi last month. Sujith Kuttan held the record from 2010 with a time of 10.65.

 

Daneshwari rewrote one of the oldest records in the book, improving on V Pandeeswari’s 11.92 seconds set in 1996. Her own previous best was 11.88 seconds, clocked when finishing second in the Federation Cup for Juniors in September last. On Sunday, she was quick off the block and blazed away to the finish, 13-hundredths of a second outside Dutee Chand’s National mark.

Dutee closes season with 200m win to completesprint double,"October 13, 2019","Dutee closes season with 200m win to completesprint double

AFI Media

Ranchi, October 13:Dutee Chand (Odisha) dug into the reserves of her strength to complete the sprint double in the season-ending 59th National Open Athletics Championships, clocking the fastest time by an Indian this season with a 23.17-second burst in the women’s 200m final at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium here on Sunday.

Having set a National mark in the 100m, Dutee Chand added the half-lapper gold to her collection, showing her challenger Archana Suseendran a clean pair of heels. She not only topped the Tamil Nadu sprinter’s time of 23.18 seconds clocked in the AFI Grand Prix in Patiala on August 16 but also logged in her own second fastest time behind the 23.00 timed in the Asian Games last year.

There was intense competition at the triple jump pit, even in Asian Games gold medallist Arprinder Singh’s absence. Abdulla Aboobacker challenged his Services team-mate Karthik Unnikrishnan till the very last jump in an event that saw the top six competitors cross the 16m mark. Karthik Unnikrishnan, who took the lead with a 16.61m in the third round, leapt 16.78m on his final try.

Chinta Yadav emerged a surprise winner of the women’s 3000m steeplechase, outsprinting her Railways team-mate Parul Chaudhary. The favourite did strive hard over the final 100m to bridge the gap and lunge ahead in a thrilling finish but Chinta Yadav had enough left in the tank to break the beam in 10 minutes 11.70 seconds.

Railways’ PU Chitra was another athlete who completed the double, adding the women’s 800m crown to the 1500m title she won earlier this week. With Lili Das, expected to offer her a stiff challenge, dropping out, Chitra did not have to worry overmuch in winning the two-lap race in 2 minutes 04.59 seconds.

Railways bagged the overall championship title leaving behind Services on second spot while Haryana finished third. Tajinderpal Singh Toor finished as best athlete in men’s category while Dutee Chand grabbed the best athlete title in the women’s category.

The seasoned MR Poovamma led the women finishers in 24.05 seconds ahead of Hima Das (24.21) and Shubha (24.83) while Arokia Raj broke the beam in the men’s race in 20.72 seconds ahead of Muhammad Anas Yahiya (21.09) and Jabir (21.76).

We have a good team of 32 athletes though our quota for the Games was 36. Injury concerns forced Olympic Champion and 2018 CWG gold medallist in javelin throw Neeraj Chopra and shot putter Tajinder Singh Toor to pull out of the Games. In 4x400m men’s relay team, we have replaced Rajesh Ramesh who has minor injury and could not perform as expected at the World Championships with Mohammed Anas,”
“Two female athletes are dropped from the team after they failed a dope test. We have zero tolerance for doping. I am also pleased that entry of high jumper Tejaswin Shankar has been accepted by the Games organising committee. Overall, we are expecting a good performance from these youngsters and we want them to give their best and win more medals for India,” he said.

Aishwarya’s leap puts Tajinderpal Toor and Annu Rani’s efforts in the shade,"June 12, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 12: Karnataka Long Jumper B Aishwarya’s explosive effort in the qualifying round put solid efforts by Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani in the shade on the third day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

Aishwarya produced a stunning 6.73m leap in the women’s Long Jump qualifying round for a new Meet Record. Other familiar names like Ancy Sojan and Nayana James (both Kerala) and World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) also made it. to the final without fuss.

The 24-year-old Aishwarya’s effort pitchforked her to the second place on the Indian all-time list behind Anju Bobby George who set the National Record at 6.83m in the Athens Olympics in 2004 and backed it with a 6.75m effort to win the World Athletics Final in 2005. She took over the meet record from Mayookha Johny, who had pegged it at 6.63m in 2011.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s search for 20m puts ended on Sunday evening when he was able to send the iron ball past that mark three times. Despite registering no marks on two visits to the circle, the 27-year-old Olympian came up with three efforts over 20.14m, 20.29m and 20.34m to fine form and run out an easy winner.

Uttar Pradesh’s Annu Rani, India’s only woman Javelin thrower in the 60m club, had only two legal throws on Sunday but the second of those was over 60.93m. She has thrown the spear farther twice this season, but she will be happy that she has regained the consistency that she had embraced in the rup up to the Olympic Games last year.

There was a shock in store for Andhra Pradesh’s 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, who made waves with a series of good races overseas during which she took ownership of the National Record with a 13.04-second effort in the Netherlands. She did not find the rhythm, knocking a couple of hurdles down and tumbling on to the track after crashing into the final hurdle.

Tamil Nadu’s C Kanimozhi won the event in 13.62 seconds, becoming the second fastest Indian in the event this year. Jyothi Yarraji has the top six times and Kanimozhi improved her season’s best from 14.07 seconds to rise to the second spot behind the National Record holder and above the likes of Nandini Agasara (Telangana) and Aparna Roy (Kerala).

Himachal Pradesh’s Ankesh Chaudhary (1:50.02), Haryana’s Krishan Kumar (1:51.19) and Kerala’s Mohammed Afsal (1:52.22) won their respective heats to make it to the men’s 800m final.

Shot Putter Manpreet Kaur becomes first Indian women to breach 18m mark,"June 11, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 11: Assam sprinters Hima Das and Amlan Borgohain claimed the titles of the fastest woman and man of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday evening. However, it was 31-year-old Shot Putter Manpreet Kaur (Haryana) who took the second day’s honours with a new National Record.

Manpreet Kaur opened with 16.38m but after being in second place, she upped the game with a 16.65m try to take the lead. Her third attempt was over 17.54m to rewrite the meet record held by Harbans Kaur and to gain Commonwealth Games qualification. She then wound herself up for the first 18m Put by an Indian with an effort of 18.06m on her fourth visit.

Javelin Throwers DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) both sent the spear over 80m mark. Rohit Yadav produced four throws past 80m, taking the meet mark on his opening try over 82.45m and with 82.54 on his fifth try being his best. But Manu improved the meet mark with a winning try of 84.35m on his third attempt.

Long Jumpers Muhammed Anees Yahiya (Kerala) and M Sreeshankar (Kerala) became the other athletes to break a meet mark when they leapt to 8.15m and 8.23m respectively. Sreeshankar had improved the meet mark to 8.01 in the qualifying round on Friday and ensured that it would stay with him with a winning effort.

Hima Das stunned Odisha’s Dutee Chand and Srabani Nanda with the second fastest sprint by an Indian woman this year, clocking 11.43 seconds. Not been beaten over the distance this year, Dutee Chand was a hundredth of a second behind. Tamil Nadu’s S Dhanalakhsmi, whose 11.26s in Turkey a week ago, is the fastest time by an Indian this season, skipped the 100m.

Amlan Borgohain edged out Tamil Nadu’s K Elakkiyadasan in the men’s race, winning in 10.47 seconds. Like in Hima Das’s conquest, his margin of victory was also one hundredth of a second over Elakkiyadasan. Harjit Singh, fastest in the semifinals, was third by a fair distance behind the two.

Karnataka quartermiler Priya H Mohan’s withdrawl from the women’s 400m final was expected to take the edge out, but Kiran Pahal (Haryana) and Rupal Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) provided excitement in a thrilling race. The Haryana sprinter won by a margin of just a quarter of a second as the top two competitors dipped in under 53 seconds.

The men’s 400m final saw Amoj Jacob establish himself as India’s best quartermiler. He was the only one who broke the 46-second barrier, coming home in an Indian season best time of 45.68 seconds.

Jeswin Aldrin steals National Record holder Sreeshankar’s thunder in Long Jump battle,"April 3, 2022","AFI Media 

Calicut, April 3: J Jeswin Aldrin (Tamil Nadu) came with a stunning wind-aided leap of 8.37m to beat Olympian S Sreeshankar (Kerala) in a fierce but friendly battle to grab the attention on the second day of the 25th AFI National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships in the C H Muhammed Koya Stadium here on Sunday.

On a day that saw nine jumps over 8m, Jeswin Aldrin produced a fine series that saw all five of his valid efforts past that mark while each of Sreeshankar sailed over that distance on each of his three valid tries, including an 8.36m that helped him improve his own National Record by 10cm and a place among the 10 best Asians ever in Long Jump.

Less than a month ago, the 20-year-old, who hails from Tiruchirapalli, broke into the select band of Indians in the 8m club when he won the Indian Grand Prix 2 in Thiruvananthapuram with 8.20m.

In a gripping contest, Sreeshankar opened with 8.16m and Jeswin Aldrin responded with 8.01. The younger jumper leapt 8.37m but a tail wind of 4.1m/s denied him the National and meet records. A fired up Sreeshankar could not stop Jeswin Aldrin from winning gold but came up with 8.36m on his third attempt to improve his own National and meet marks.

The exciting battle at the Long Jump pit helped Jeswin Aldrin and Sreeshankar steal the thunder from Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra) who had brought everyone to the edge of their seats with a sensational 400m sprint in 51.18 seconds, the fifth best time by an Indian woman and a meet record.

Scorching the track from the start, she appeared to run a race of her own. It became apparent by the halfway stage that she would by a big margin, leaving the others to battle for the second spot. Only Hima Das, three times in 2018, and Manjeet Kaur, once in 2004, have run quicker than Aishwarya Mishra.

These two performances meant that B Siva Kumar (Tamil Nadu) and Dutee Chand (Odisha), who claimed the titlesof the fastest man and woman respectively, had to settle for less of the limelight on Sunday.

The 27-year-old Siva Kumar, who clocked a personal best time of 10.37 seconds, was identified as the winner only after the photo finish equipment gave him an edge of four-thousandths of a second over Tamil Nadu team-mate Elakkiadasan.  Dutee Chand returned to winning ways after suffering defeats in the Federation Cup and National Inter-State Championships last year.

Sourabh Rathi, a 21-year-old from Uttar Pradesh, marked his debut in the senior ranks with a Decathlon gold. With a determined effort in the 1500m, the final of the 10 events, he leapfrogged past the leaders Boota Singh and Mohit. Boota Singh looked set to add a fourth National-level crown but was a slow 1500m meant he finished 24 points behind Sourabh Rathi.

There were good victories for Ajay Kumar Saroj (Uttar Pradesh) and Lili Das (West Bengal) in the men and women’s 1500m races, both having to showcase their ability to produce a kick to outsprint Rahul (Delhi) and Ankita Dhyani (Uttarakhand) respectively.

Earlier in the day, Andhra Pradesh’s Jyothi Yarraji clocked 13.43 seconds to top her 100m Hurdles heats in a new meet record time, improving on Anuradha Biswal’s 13.48 seconds effort in New Delhi 16 years ago.

"Seema Antil breaks two-decade-old record, books berth in Tokyo2020 with 63.72m throw","June 29, 2021","Patiala, June 29: Seema Antil (Uttar Pradesh) qualified for the discus throw competition in the Olympic Games in Tokyo with a 63.72m throw on the final day of the Fast&Up 60th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Tuesday. She became the 12th individual Indian athlete to qualify for Tokyo2020.

Having reached Patiala from Belarus in the wee hours of June 27, the 37-year-old went past the 60m mark on four of her five legal throws, going close to the Olympic Qualifying mark of 63.50m with her third effort of 63.18m that was a new meet record before finding the power to breach the Olympic standard with her fourth try.

Without a world ranking since she was nursing a glutes injury, Seema Antil was taking part in only her third competition since the 2018 Asian Games. She threw 62.64m in ṭhe Federation Cup here in March and after managing 58.62 in Minsk on June 25, she secured her ticket to the fourth Olympic Games with her first throws over 63m since August 7, 2004 in Kiev.

“I know I can throw farther with my training but I was wary of aggravating the issue with my glutes muscles. I have worked hard over the last two and half years since the Asian Games and am happy that I could secure qualification today. I will consult the Athletics Federation of India and draw up my training programme for the Olympic Games,” she said.

Besides the 4x400m mixed relay squad,  Avinash Sable (men’s 3000m Steeplechase), Tajinderpal Singh Toor (men’s Shot Put), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (men’s Javelin Throw), M Sreeshankar (men’s Long Jump), Kamalpreet Kaur (women’s Discus Throw) and race walkers KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (men) and Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (women) have already qualified for the Olympic Games.

There is expectation that some others like MP Jabir (men’s 400m Hurdles), Dutee Chand (women’s 200m), Annu Rani (women’s Javelin Throw) will make it on the strength of their world ranking. Besides if the men and women’s relay teams, ranked 13 and 16 on the Road to Olympic Games list at the time of writing, may raise the size of the Indian athletics team.

With World Athletics responding positively to the Athletics Federation of India request to consider the 3:01.89 clocked in the 4x400m heats on Friday, the men’s team was restored to the 13th place ahead of Germany, Poland and Czech Republic. It let the men’s team to rest Amoj Jacob and run a relaxed race today.

Running with a changed combination after Hima Das pulled out, the Indian women’s 4x100m relay squad of AK Daneshwari, Archana Suseendran, S Dhanalakshmi and Dutee Chand had to content itself with a new meet record time of 44.15 seconds, short of its target (43.03 seconds) that would have earned it a berth in the Olympic Games.

Hima Das tried gamely to compete in the women’s 200m final, chasing 22.80 seconds to qualify, but finished fifth in 25.03 seconds. PD Anjali (Kerala) and Lovepreet Singh (Punjab) were the winners of the women’s and men’s 200m sprints in 24.01 seconds and 21.04 seconds respectively.

Gurindervir Singh breaks 100m meet record; Dhanalakshmi win fastest woman crown,"June 26, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, June 26: Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) set the athletics track in the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports ablaze with a new meet record time of 10.27 seconds as he won the men’s 100m in the Fast&UP 60th National Inter-State Athletics Championships on Saturday. S Dhanalakshmi (Tamil Nadu) confirmed his growing stature as India’s premier woman sprinter by handing Dutee Chand another defeat in the final.

The 20-year-old Gurindervir Singh, who has held sway in the sprints in the recent times, was quickly off the blocks, found the pace and the momentum to leave his team-mate Lovepreet Singh and the National Record holder Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha ) fighting for the lesser medals.

With Hima Das pulling up injured after finishing third in heats in the morning, the women’s race was expected to be a clash featuring Dhanalakshmi and her more experienced team-mates Dutee Chand and Archana Suseendran as well as Sri Lanka’s Amasha de Silva. Dhanalakshmi powered away to a good victory in 11.52 seconds.

The sprinters shared the limelight with the rising long jumper Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh). Preparing for the World Junior Athletics Championships, to be held in Kenya in August, she leapt to a career best distance of 6.48m in the Punjabi University facility to be among the world’s top ranked junior jumpers this year.

At the same venue, National Record holder Tejaswin Shankar cleared 2.20m effortlessly to win the men’s High Jump. He made a game attempt to get the meet record by raising the bar to 2.26m after two unsuccessful jumps at 2.23m. He achieved his primary aim of raking up some points to move up the World Athletics Ranking with a win here.

Uttar Pradesh’s 19-year-old Usaid Khan won the gruelling decathlon competition with an all-round effort that fetched him 6893 points. He improved on his showing in the Federation Cup in March when he had a 6820-point haul. S Gokul (Kerala) kept Gurlal Singh (Punjab) at bay in the race for the silver medal.

Indian Men’s 4x400m Relay Team ups the ante and gets closer to Olympic berth,"June 25, 2021","AFI Media

PATIALA, June 25: The Indian men’s 4x400m relay team on Friday enhanced its chances of qualifying for the Olympic Games in Tokyo next month with a 3:01.89 effort that would lift it from 16th on the World Athletics Road to Olympic Games ranking to 13th in the 60th Fast&Up National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here.

Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv and Noah Nirmal Tom took the track with the singular aim of improving its time from 3:02.61 in the Indian Grand Prix 4 here on Monday. It could heave a sigh of relief after the squad attained that goal with a determined effort against the clock.

An Indian team had clocked 3:02.59 in Turkey on July 25, 2019, but that time had left it in the 16th place. With the Olympic qualification window closing on June 29, the squad had to come up with its fastest effort since July 10, 2016 when Kunju Muhammed, Muhammad Anas, Ayyasamy Dhrun and Arokia Rajiv clocked 3:00.91 in Bengaluru – the best by an Indian team.

The women’s 4x100m quartet of Archana Suseendran, Hima Das, S Dhanalakshmi and Dutee Chand, chasing the magical mark of 43.05 seconds to attain qualification for the Olympic Games, was 0.45 seconds short in the heats on Friday. The team, which set a New National Record of 43.47 seconds in the Indian Grand Prix 4 on Monday, was credited with a time faster than the meet record (45.69) standing in the name of Tamil Nadu.

C Kanimozhi, who clocked a personal best of 13.63 in the 100m Hurdles in the Federation Cup here on March 15 this year, held off a challenge by Agasara Nandini. The Telangana girl improved on her own career best from 13.88 to 13.70. Sri Lanka’s WVL Sugandi had to settle for the third place behind the two Indians who have battled for the 100m hurdles prize this year.

Madhya Pradesh’s Vikram Bharatsingh Bangriya won the gruelling men’s 10000m race from Kartik Kumar (Uttar Pradesh) while Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) dominated the women’s 5000m event, winning comfortably from Maharashtra’s Komal Chandrakant Jadgalde and Ankita Dhyani (Uttarakhand).

Returning to competition after nearly two years, Manju Bala (Rajasthan) claimed the Hammer Throw gold with a 61.08m effort on her fifth try at the Punjabi University ground. As many as five of her throws were better than the second-placed Sarita R Singh (Uttar Pradesh) whose best was a 56.13 on a day when she registered three no marks.

In the men’s 100m heats in the morning, Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) caught the eye with a 10.41 seconds sprint while Amiya Malik (Odisha) showed glimpses of regaining form with 10.50 seconds in winning his heats.

Fast&Up National Inter-State may witness intense competition for Olympic berths,"June 24, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, June 24: There is more than the usual excitement that accompanies any national-level athletics meet on the eve of the five-day Fast & Up National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here from Friday. It is the last chance for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games and a high level of competition is expected.

Graded as B category event for the World Athletics ranking, it offers more than a few athletes the chance to make it to the Tokyo Olympic Games. For the athletes who can make it to the Games on the strength of their rankings, this is an opportunity to consolidate their rankings and secure a berth in Tokyo2020.

A bunch of Sri Lankans are also lining up to use the last chance saloon to earn themselves a place in the Games. Nadeesha Ramanayake (women’s 400m) and Nimali Waliwarsha (women’s 800m) are among the prominent names from the Island nation. Nadeesha is 59th and Nimali 57th in their respective events in the Road to Olympic Games rankings

It is the 10th national-level event that the AFI is conducting this year, including two for juniors, a race-walking championship, a cross-country championship, four Grand Prix meets and the Federation Cup. AFI has worked hard, with support from the Sports Authority of India, to offer the athletes the maximum chances to qualify for Tokyo2020 and improve their ranking.

Kamalpreet Kaur (women’s discus throw) and men’s shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor made the most of the opportunities in the last two meets to book their tickets to Tokyo. Others like Dutee Chand (women’s 100m), Hima Das (women’s 200m) and Harmilan Bains (women’s 1500m) went within hailing distance of the respective qualifying marks on Monday.

Besides, the spotlight in the Fast&Up National Inter-State Championships will be on the women’s 4x100m relay team and the men’s 4x400m relay squad.

The quartet of Dutee Chand, Hima Das, Archana Suseendran and S Dhanalakshmi will look to break the National Record for the second time in a week and aim for a 43.05-second effort to be among the 16 teams in Tokyo. The team clocked 43.37 seconds in the Indian Grand Prix 4 on Monday to be ranked 20th in the world.

Similarly, the men’s 1600m relay squad of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv and Noah Nirmal Tom will aim to improve its time from 3:02.61 on Monday to 3:02.56 or even 3:02.50 to lift itself from the present ranking of 16 and ensure that it can spend the next few weeks preparing for the Games.

Besides the 4x400m mixed relay team, as many as 11 Indian athletes have already qualified for individual events in Tokyo2020.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Article-Banner-2-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/fastupnationalinterstate/,Athletics
Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor qualifies for Tokyo2020;Four National marks set,"June 21, 2021","Patiala, June 21: Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) qualified for the Tokyo Olympic Games with a hefty 21.49m effort while sprinter Dutee Chand, discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur and the India 4x400m relay team also set new National Records in the Indian Grand Prix 4 athletics meet at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports on Monday.

The 26-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor, whose previous best was 20.92m, became the 11th individual Indian track and field athlete to qualify for Tokyo2020 by going past the qualifying mark of 21.10m with each of his four legal puts. He sealed the berth with his opening try and had other puts of 21.28, 21.13 and 21.13 besides no marks with his second and sixth attempts.

“It is a relief to be competing and I am grateful to the Athletics Federation of India for organising so many meets at home to give us chances to qualify for the Olympics,” Tajinderpal Singh Toor said. “I was throwing around 22m last year but Corona troubled the world. I had to get my body back in line, but when I did that, competitions were cancelled. I am glad that I could be at my best today. I was aiming for 21.50m and I got that with my first try.”

Dutee Chand mounted a gallant effort to crack the Olympic qualifying standard of 11.15 seconds in the women’s 100m. While she rewrote her own National Record, she was a heart-breaking two-hundredths of a second away from the magic mark. She also anchored the Indian team to a victory in the 4x100m relay in 43.37 seconds.

Kamalpreet Kaur also said she wanted to show her gratitude for the opportunity to compete with a good series as the sole competitor in the women’s Discus Throw event. Aiming for a 69m effort on Monday, she started with 63.41m throw before two fouls. She followed those with a 62.33m throw and uncorked her new National Record throw of 66.69m.

There were also game efforts by Hima Das (Assam) in the women’s 200m and Harmilan Kaur Bains (Punjab) in the women’s 1500m to take a crack at the Olympic qualifying marks but both fell short by small margins. Hima Das won the sprint in 22.88 seconds, a mere 0.08 seconds off the qualifying mark while Harmilan Bains, chasing 4:04.20, won the metric mile in 4:08.27.

"Outrun by covid driven travel ban, India relay team stranded at home","April 28, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, April 28: Indian women’s 4x100m and men’s 4x400m relay teams are left stranded at home as the new Covid-19 driven travel bans are put in place by various countries. The Indian squad will be missing from the action at the World Athletics Relays Silesia 21 on May 1 and 2 at Chorzow in Poland after the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) that was to fly the runners intimated that it would be unable to let them board the flight from Mumbai in the wake of the Netherlands government ban on passenger flights from India.

India was set to field the men’s 4x400m and women’s 4x100m relay squads in the World Athletics Relays Silesia 21.

Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President said, “We are very disappointed at this moment. There are no direct flights between Indian airports and Warsaw, Poland. This meant that despite the best efforts, the squad could not be rerouted on another airline,”

“For the last 24-hours we have been consistently trying to find alternatives, we have used all the resources to sort this out, we have been constantly speaking to the Organisers, the World Athletics, various consulates and airlines to reroute them. Under the present scenario nobody has obliged,”

The women’s 4x100m team includes India’s top sprinters such as Hima Das, Dutee Chand, Dhanalaxmi Sekhar, Archana Suseentran, Daneshwari TA and Himashree Roy while men’s 4x400m squad is comprised of Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Arokia Rajeev, Amoj Jacob, Nirmal Noah Tom and Sarthak Bhambri.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AFI-travel-ban-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/outrun-by-covid-driven-travel-ban-india-relay-team-stranded-at-home/,Athletics
AFI names 20-member squad for next month’s World Athletics Relays in Poland,"April 6, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, April 6: Athletics Federation of India has on Tuesday named a 20-member squad of athletes, including seven women 100m runners, to compete in the World Athletics Relays Silesia21 in the Silesian Stadium in Chorzow, Poland, on May 1 and 2. It will be the first major international event for the sprinters since the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha in April 2019.

“We are excited to get our athletes ready for their first international competition after the Covid-induced gap. We are glad the team will spend time in training in Turkey before it reaches Chorzow of the World Athletics Relays,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said.

“We were able to organise meets in NIS Patiala in February and March so that our athletes had a feel of competition.”

The AFI President said the coaching staff was confident that the athletes would be ready to deliver their best performance. “The Federation has done everything in its power to enable the athletes stay healthy and train through the lockdown and beyond and be ready for international competition,” he said.

Mr. Sumariwalla said AFI was happy that its focus on women’s 100m sprinters in National camps has paid off. “With S Dhanalakshmi emerging on the scene in the Federation Cup last month, she and Dutee Chand are two Indian runners who have run sub-11.50 times this season. We believe the 4x100m women’s team with Dhanalakshmi, Dutee, Hima Das and Archana Suseendran can come up with a good effort,” he said.

Meanwhile, Olympic bound javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh along with Rohit Yadav, Rajender Singh and Annu Rani are also being cleared by AFI for a training camp in Turkey later this month.

Discus thrower Kamalpreet Kaur uncorks National Record throw to secure Olympic berth,"March 19, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 19: Kamalpreet Kaur’s one legal throw in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships on Friday rewrote the women’s Discus Throw National Record and claimed her a spot in the Olympic Games competition to be held in Tokyo later this year. Her 65.06m opening effort did the trick for her, producing the fourth National Record in five days.

With a sustained burst of speed, Hima Das (Assam) with a time of 23.21 seconds left S Dhanalakhsmi (23.39s) and Archana Suseendran (23.60s) fighting for the silver medal in the high-profile women’s 200m final. K Elakkiadasan claimed the mens 200m while Ayyasamy Dharun and R Vithya Ramraj won the men and women’s 400m Hurdles to ease Tamil Nadu contingent’s pain somewhat.

On a day when the men’s Triple Jump competition saw an intense battle, with Karthik Unnikrishnan producing a last-ditch 16.73m and Abdulla managing a 16.59 on his last try to push their Kerala team-mate Eldhose Paul to the third place with a best 16.53m that he had got on his second jump, it was Kamalpreet Kaur’s solitary throw that stole the limelight.

The 25-year-old from Badal in Punjab was not overawed by the presence of the 2014 Asian Games champion Seema Punia. Nor did Kamalpreet Kaur did not let the fact that she had a couple of 60m-plus behind her affect her. The earlier such throws came in the 2018 Inter-Railway Championships in Lucknow (61.04m) and the 2019 Federation Cup here (60.25m).

With Seema Punia coming up a no mark on her opening throw, Kamalpreet could enter the fray without training on her mind on a target distance but only focused on giving her best. She wound herself up well and unleashed the biggest throw by an Indian woman, surpassing the National record that has stood at 64.76m in the name of Krishan Poonia since 2012.

Seema Punia, who has won a medal in each of her four Commonwealth Games appearances and has two Asian Games medals, fought hard to mark her return to competition after the 2018 Asian Games with a victory. She came up with four throws in excess of 60.50m but her best was the 62.64m that she managed on her fifth attempt.

Kamalpreet this became the 10th Indian to secure the Tokyo Olympic Games athletics qualification mark laid down by World Athletics. Of course, the Mixed team in the 4x400m relay has also secured a berth in the Tokyo Games. Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Dutee Chand (100m) and Annu Rani (Javelin Throw) can get into the Olympic competition by virtue of their World ranking.

Those who had booked their Olympic tickets earlier include Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), KT Irfan, Sandeep Kumar and Rahul Rohila (20km Race Walk), M Sreeshankar (Long Jump), Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh (Javelin Throw) among the men, Bhawna Jat and Priyanka Goswami (20km Race Walk) among women.

Dhanalakshmi breaks Usha’s meet record and eyes sprint double in Federation Cup,"March 18, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 18: S Dhanalakshmi (Tamil Nadu), who stunned Dutee Chand in the 100m final on Tuesday, emerged as the sprinter to beat in the women’s 200m, clocking a Meet Record time of 23.26 seconds in the women’s 200m semifinals in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports on Thursday.

Her victory over Hima Das (Assam) who clocked 24.39 seconds in the semifinal heats lifted her to the top 10 of Indian all-time list. Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) won her semifinal heats in 24.07 seconds to raise expectations of a good final. It must be stated that both Hima Das (23.10) and Archana Suseendran (23.18) have faster times than the one blazed by Dhanalakshmi on Thursday.

Her time broke PT Usha’s long-standing meet record of 23.30 seconds set in Chennai in 1998. Having run 24.05 seconds when finishing third in the Federation Cup here two years ago, she recorded a 23.47 in the Tamil Nadu State Championships in Sivakasi on January 24, thus making it the second time she was dipping in under 23.50 seconds.

Returning to competition after a long break, Swapna Barman won the Heptathlon with a total of 5636 points, her 1.82m High Jump making up for the 2:29.98 in the 800m. Mareena George (Kerala) finished second, a poor shot put performance denying her a shot at beating the 2018 Asian Games champion in the gruelling seven-event challenge.

The front-running Krishan Kumar (Haryana) beat back a stiff challenge over the last 100m by Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) in the men’s 800m. Those trailing Krishan Kumar at the bell may have been expected him to slow down but he chugged on. Ankesh Chaudhary stepped up the pace and even held the lead for a brief while on the home straight but he could not power on.

Delhi’s Chanda won the women’s 800m in a personal best time of 2 minutes 2.57 seconds. It was the fastest time clocked by an Indian woman since Tintu Luka’s 2:00.58 in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on August 17, 2016. It was a brave start-to-finish effort by Chanda, but she finished outside the Olympic Games qualification mark set at 1:59.50.

Lili Das (Bengal) moved up from sixth place with 150m left and timed her shift to the outside lane to a nicety to be able to slip past MR Poovamma (Karnataka) with only a few strides left for the finish. It was Lili Das’ personal best time, too, the 2:02.98 improving on the 2:03.46 that she clocked in Guntur in July 2017. Poovamma (2:03.35) also earned her personal best.

In fact, with Rachna (Haryana), Shalu Chaudhary (Delhi) and Aishwarya Mishra (Maharashtra) also clocking their best times, the women’s half-mile saw the top six runners attain new peaks respectively.

Talking of personal bests, Gracena Glistus Mery (Tamil Nadu) attained one with a 1.84m effort to win the women’s High Jump. The 20-year-old cleared that height on her second attempt after having needed three tries to cross the bar when it was placed at 1.81m. Her previous best of 1.79m was achieved in the University trials in Bhubaneshwar on March 8.

The last time an Indian woman jumped higher than Gracena Mery’s 1.84m was back on June 3, 2017 when heptathlete Swapna Barman cleared 1.87m. The girl from Kanyakumari thus becomes the latest Indian high jumper to join the 1.80m club. Her clearance drew gasps since it was the height that was good for bronze medal in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018.

Sreeshankar’s National Record leap pitchforks him to Olympic Games in Tokyo,"March 16, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 16: Long Jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) gave himself a double bonanza as an early birthday present – booking his place in the Olympic Games competition with a National Record leap of 8.26m in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships 2021 at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex here on Tuesday.

On a day when Tamil Nadu’s S Dhanalakshmi handed Dutee Chand (Odisha) a rare defeat in a national competition as she blazed the track to win the women’s 100m sprint in a stunning time of 11.39 seconds and Amoj Jacob (Delhi) secured a personal best in winning the men’s 400m, it was Sreeshankar’s National Record that stole the thunder.

Sreeshankar found the perfect combination of acceleration, take off and elevation on his fifth attempt to realise his dream of securing an automatic entry in the Olympic Games by breaching the entry standard of 8.22m. The World No. 24 improved on his own National mark of 8.20m, set in Bhubaneshwar on September 27, 2018.

Getting off the pit, he sensed that he had attained his goal, holding his arms aloft as he watched the officials measure the distance. His joy knew no bounds when he got the confirmation on the electronic board. On each of his four previous attempts, he had breached the 8.00m mark with a string that read 8.02, 8.04, 8.07 and 8.09. He found the explosive combination on the fifth try.

“I am thankful to everyone who supported me to achieve this result. I wanted to prove a point as everyone thought 8.20 was my peak and after that my performance was not the same. I am really very happy,” said Sreeshankar.

Delhi’s 23-year-old Amoj Jacob showed a fine turn of speed to combine with staying power to claim the men’s quarter-mile crown with a career best time of 45.68 against more experienced runners. On the contrary, M R Poovamma’s resilience and determination in the women’s 400m proved too good against a bunch of youngsters, each eager to make an impression.

Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) dominated the men’s 100m dash, winning in 10.32 seconds, showing that the personal best of 10.30 seconds achieved in the semifinals was not a flash in the pan. He was a picture of confidence and power as he led from gun to beam, leaving K Elakkiadasan (Tamil Nadu) and Krishnakumar Satish Rane (Maharashtra) to fight for the second spot.

In the women’s 100m final, the 22-year-old Dhanalakshmi scripted a start-to-finish win, riding on an explosive start that placed her in the lead very early in the blue riband race. If there were any signs of nerves when she was up against the likes of Dutee Chand, Hima Das and Archana Suseendran, Dhanalakshmi did not let anyone see that, powering her way to a famous victory.

Dhanalakshmi produced only her second best time, a hundredths of a second slower than the 11.38 seconds she had clocked in the semifinal heats on Monday. Dutee Chand tried hard to catch up but the girl from Tiruchirapalli showed no signs of slowing down as she broke the beam 0.19 seconds before the Asian Games medallist and World Universities Games champion.

Those who scurried to the record books discovered that the last time Dutee Chand did not win a race featuring only Indians was back in the Inter-Railway Championship in Bhopal in August 2015, a month after she ended up with bronze in the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Chennai.

Late in the day, Harmilan Kaur Bains (Punjab) spreadeagled the women’s 1500m field that included PU Chitra (Kerala) and Lili Das (West Bengal) with a personal best time of 4:08.70. She set a hot pace from the start and only Chitra tried to catch up in the first lap and a half, only to realise that Harmilan Kaur Bains was in a league of her own.

It was the second fastest time for a metric mile by an Indian woman, the National Record of 4:06.03 having been set by Sunita Rani in the Busan Asian Games back in October 2002. The 22-year-old Harmilan Kaur Bains is daughter of former middle-distance runners Amandeep Bains and Madhuri Singh, who won the 800m silver in the Busan Asian Games.

Javelin Thrower Annu Rani rewrites National Record to give Federation Cup great start,"March 15, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 15: Javelin Thrower Annu Rani’s single-minded determination to produce a throw in excess of the Olympic qualification standard of 64.00m led her to rewriting her own National Record with a 63.24m effort on the opening day of the 24th Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex here on Monday.

The 27-year-old World No. 12 came up with a standout performance, with three throws beyond 61m, and she led Uttar Pradesh to a three-gold show in four finals. The ball was set rolling by Savita Pal, 21, who made her debut in a 10000m race a memorable one by sprinting past Sanjvani Jadhav (Maharashtra). Shot putter Kiran Baliyan accounted for Uttar Pradesh’s third gold with a 16.45m effort.

The consistent Annu Rani did not belie expectations on Monday. She opened with a throw of 61.45m and backed it up with another over 61.03m. Having warmed up to the task, she then uncorked a throw over 63.24m that was an improvement of 81 centimeters on the National Record that she set in the World Athletics Championships in Doha in 2019.

Muhammad Anas Yahiya (Kerala) showed his form by topping the men’s 400m qualification for the final with a 46.26-second run. His pace helped Haryana’s Ayush Dabas make it to the final as one of the two fastest non-automatic qualifiers. Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) was another who won his semifinal heats in 46.84 and enabled Jashanjot Singh to make the final grace.

Earlier, Amoj Jacob cantered to stop the clock in his heats in 47.80 seconds. With P Naganathan also clocking a sub-47, the men’s 400m final promises quite some fireworks. There is no doubt that each of the eight finalists will put his best foot forward in what can become the most talked about men’s final on Tuesday.

The seasoned MR Poovamma led the eight qualifiers into the women’s 400m final, powering to victory in 54.34 seconds, the second fastest time this season. Eager to show that she is India’s premier quarter-miler, the 29-year-old ran a fine race in the opening heats, winning by over 2-1/2 seconds.

Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra), who won the second of the three semifinal heats, dipped home in 55.05 seconds. The Haryana trio of 20-year-old Kiran Pahal, 18-year-old Deepanshi and Nancy, 21, and Tamil Nadu’s Subha Venkatesan, also 21, all came home inside 56.15 seconds to raise visions of a bright future for the women’s 400m.

Tamil Nadu’s S Dhanalakshmi warmed the hearts of sprint fans with a fine race in the women’s 100m semifinals. She threw down the gauntlet for Dutee Chand (Odisha) with a 11.38-second 100m sprint that stunned viewers just as much as it would have her State-mate Archana Suseendran, who was second in that heat in 11.66 seconds.

Taking to the track after Assam’s Hima Das won her heats in 11.63 seconds, Dutee Chand clocked 11.51 without straining every sinew. Featuring the three sprinters, there is no doubt that the final will spark excitement and great expectations of being a spectacle.

In the afternoon, Gurindervir Singh (Punjab) set a personal best time of 10.30 seconds in the men’s 100m semifinals. It was the third fastest time by an Indian sprinter behind the 10.21 clocked by Anil Kumar in the year 2000) and the 10.26 clocked by Amiya Kumar Mallick (2016) and Sanjeet Singh (2018). It equaled the 10.30 by Mohammed Abdul Najeeb Qureshi (2010).

Exploding to a good start, he blazed the track to leave the field gaping in awe. Telangana’s Amlan Borgohain was the second fastest qualifier, winning his semifinal heats in 10.44 seconds. Harjit Singh (Punjab) was the only other sprinter to dip in under 10.50 seconds when he won his semifinal heats in 10.48.

Federation Cup offers platform for Indians to showcase evolution ahead of Tokyo Olympics,"March 14, 2021","AFI Media 

Patiala, March 14: An air of expectation is in evidence at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports complex as it hosts the ageasFederal Life Insurance 24th Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships from Monday. As many as 643 athletes have registered for the 38 events in the five-day meet that will offer an indication of the enthusiasm and evolution of the country’s best track and field stars.

With the postponed Tokyo Olympic Games, scheduled to start on July 23 this year, a number of athletes will be looking to consolidate their rankings with good performances here, if not to attain qualifying marks. For the likes of Steeplechaser Avinash Sable and Javelin Thrower Neeraj Chopra, the Federation Cup would be a platform too chisel the rough edges further.

The three Indian Grand Prix meets (February 18, 25 and March 5) built the stage for the Federation Cup championships. Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra’s new National Record (88.07m) on March 5, long jumper M Sreeshankar’s 8.05m effort the previous week and sprinter Dutee Chand’s comfortable victories in the 100m in the first two meets were the highlights.

Of the four finals on the opening day, the women’s 10000m and javelin throw events will hold greater attention of fans and connoisseurs alike. Long distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav will return to national-level track competition after serving a two-year sanction. She will be up against 2019 South Asian Games silver medalist Kavita Yadav, Arati Patil and a crop of younger competitors.

In the past couple of years, India’s top woman javelin thrower Annu Rani has had precious little competition, but she will try and dig deep within her reserves to match the Olympic qualification standard of 64.00. She has embraced consistency, only rarely not producing a throw in excess of 60m. It has taken her to the World No. 12 ranking.

Away from the finals, there will be considerable interest in Dutee Chand’s quest to stop the clock inside the 11.15-second mark that would secure automatic qualification for the Olympic Games in Tokyo. Sreeshankar will feature in the Long Jump qualifying while Asian Games 800m gold medalist Manjit Singh will return to competition after nearly two years when he runs the 1500m.

Besides, the availability, form and fitness of the men and women’s 400m runners will also evoke more than cursory attention. Muhammed Anas Yahiya, Amoj Jacob, Arokia Rajiv, Dharun Ayyasamy will all showcase their prowess in the two rounds for men on Monday while the women’s first round heats will offer some important pointers.

The Standard Operating Procedures, laid down by the Athletics Federation of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, will be in force. Competitors, who are expected to have a RTPCR Negative Report, are being allowed entry into the NIS Campus only two hours before their respective events.

With no spectators being allowed in the NIS Campus, AFI will facilitate the live streaming of events on its YouTube channel so that fans have a ringside view of the competition.

Amoj Jacob produces personal best 400m time to delight athletics fans,"February 25, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, February 25: Amoj Jacob (Delhi) came up with a personal best time of 46.00 seconds to win the men’s 400m in the Indian Grand Prix II at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Thursday. In improving on the 46.26 he clocked in June 2017, he showed a smart recovery from the injury that forced him to hobble out of the race in Grand Prix I last week.

Two of his relay squad team-mates, Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) and Muhammed Anas Yahiya (Kerala), were locked in a fascinating contest over the 200m sprint – part of their overall preparations. Arokia Rajiv defeated Anas, who holds the National Record, by 0.20 seconds, with a time of 21.24 seconds.

Kerala’s M Sreeshankar, competing in his first national-level Long Jump competition since October 2019, produced a best leap of 8.05m on his sixth try. He would have been pleased with his rhythm that fetched him jumps between 7.75m and 7.87m and egged by that, he went over the 8m mark to have a promising start to the season.

In the men’s Shot Put, Tajinderpal Singh’s opening effort of 19.49m was good for gold but he would have expected to throw farther in his subsequent tries. Each of his two foul throws was followed by 19.31m and 19.33m while the 18.95m put on his fourth try would have disappointed him the most.

Javelin Thrower Annu Rani (Uttar Pradesh), seeking Olympic qualifying mark of 64.00m, wound herself up and delivered a 61.22m throw with her opening effort. She followed that up with two throws over the 60m mark. She will draw much confidence from her showing here and will look to qualify for to the Tokyo Olympics rather than bank on her ranking as World No. 12.

Sprinter Dutee Chand blazed the track to win the women;s 100m in 11.44 seconds, an improvement on the 11.51 seconds she clocked last week. She is hoping to qualify for the Olympic Games by meeting the 11.15 seconds standard but will also keep an eye on conforming a place among the 56 starters in Tokyo on the basis of her ranking as World No. 33 at the moment.

In the 200m, Hima Das (Assam) made light of the absence of much competition to win in 23.31 seconds. She has run faster only three times, twice in 2018 when she had times of 23.10 In the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Guwahati and 23.22 in Gliwic Grand Prix in Poland and once in 2019 when she clocked 23.25 in Velká cena Tábora in Tabor, Czech Republic.

Olympic hopefuls in athletics return to competition after 15 months,"February 18, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, February 18: Dutee Chand breezed to 100m victory in 11.51 seconds and hogged the limelight in the Indian Grand Prix I Athletics at the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports here on Thursday. It was the first national-level track and field for seniors meet since the National Open Athletics Championships in Ranchi in October 2019.

With the cream of Indian athletics gearing up for the AFI Federation Cup to be held here next month, the Grand Prix I showed that the athletes were in good fettle. A number of personal bests was evidence of the shape that the athletes have kept themselves in, mindful of the fact that in the Olympic year they would use such a meet as part of their preparation for the task ahead.

Kerala’s Muhammad Anas Yahiya, the leading 400m runner in the country, took part in the 100m and finished a creditable second in 10.70 seconds, two-hundredths of a second behind Krishnakumar Satish Rane (Maharashtra). Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha) won the slower B Race in 10.89 seconds to take the third place overall.

S Arokia Rajiv (Tamil Nadu) showed a good turn of speed in the men’s 200m, winning the B race in 21.40 seconds to edge out Shashank Shinde (Chhattisgarh) as the fastest over the distance on Thursday. Shashank Shinde has stopped the clock at 22.21 seconds in the A race after Noah Nirmal Tom (Kerala) pulled up injured inside the first 25m.

In the women’s 200m, Anjali Devi (Haryana) ran out a comfortable winner against sprinter Kaveri Laxmana Gouda Patil (Karnataka) and fellow quarter-mile specialist Subha Venkatesan (Tamil Nadu). While Anjali’s time of 23.57 seconds was a shade below her best of 23.44 seconds, Kaveri Patil (24.45) and Subha Venkatesan (24.59) produces personal bests.

Long jumper Yugant Singh (Uttar Pradesh) marked his return to competitive athletics after four years with a personal best leap of 7.62m to edge out Haryana’s Sahil Mahabali who had taken the lead after two rounds with a 7.59m effort. The 23-yer-old Yugant Singh’s previous best was 7.58m back in the National Open Championship in September 2015.

The women’s Long Jump competition also saw a personal best for Marena George. The 25-year-old heptathlete had a best effort of 6.11m on her second try to improve on her previous best of 6.01m. Opening with a 5.81m – good enough to give her victory – she produced other legal jumps of 5.81, 5.88, 5.88 and 5.91 to dominate the event.

The three Grands Prix meets at the same venue – the other two to be held on February 25 and March 5 – are more in the nature of warm-up events for the AFI Federation Cup, slated here from March 15. The first of the three Grands Prix will offer some indication of the eagerness of the Indian athletes to retain their edge ahead of the Olympic Games.

We have had some excellent results in the three national-level meets held in the last three weeks in Bhopal, Guwahati and Ranchi and we believe that we will see similar enthusiasm and energy in the senior ranks as well,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said.

Among the other men who will draw attention of track and field fans are Muhammad Anas Yahiya and Amiya Kumar Mallick (100m), Arokia Rajiv and Noah Nirmal Tom (200m), Amoj Jacob (800m), Dharun Ayyasamy (400m Hurdles) and Yugant Shekhar Singh (Long Jump).

The athletes, coaches and other support personnel have each been asked to secure a RTPCR test for COVID-19 and submit the report upon entering NIS Campus before they are allowed in and receive their bibs. AFI has mandated that the report should have bene generated less than 72 hours before the commencement of the Grand Prix.

9th July 2020

New Delhi. India’s best track and field athletes are coming to your home screens to keep your kids active and fit! Brought to you by MILO® National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet (MILO® NIDJAM), the premier junior athletics talent hunt of the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), in partnership with Nestlé MILO®.

 

Nestlé MILO’s latest initiative, “#MILOHOMEGROUND” is a pathbreaking extension of its worldwide legacy of over 86 years of nourishing young champions by providing nutritious energy and the inspiration to grow with sports. Through this initiative, MILO® HOME GROUND will roll out workout videos inspiring kids to enjoy effective and easy exercises demonstrated by leading AFI sporting heroes like Hima Das, Neeraj Chopra, KT Irfan, Md. Anas Yahiya, MR Poovama and many more. These videos will be available for free on the social media handles of MILO® (@MiloIndia)  and MILO® NIDJAM (@MiloNidjam).

Commenting on the launch of the campaign, Mr. Vineet Singh, Director – Dairy, Nestlé India said, “In more than 50 countries, MILO® inspires parents on the importance of sports in helping their kids achieve everyday victories that instil values to help them succeed in life. MILO® HOME GROUND aims to create opportunities for these everyday victories and get kids to stay active even while staying home. In collaboration with the Athletics Federation of India and the AFI athletes as part of MILO® NIDJAM, we are excited to offer fun exercise routines that children can do at home – by themselves or with parents. When a child successfully completes an exercise, they can win the MILO® Green Card, which rewards positive behaviour, a welcome change from the usual Red and Yellow cards that are awarded for bad behaviour.”

The President of Athletics Federation of India, Mr. Adille Sumariwalla said, “Sports in the life of a growing child is most fundamental. An active lifestyle leads to healthier families and this kind of lifestyle begins at home. The partnership with Milo, a brand who stands for giving nourishing energy to kids for an active and healthy lifestyle, is going to help us to spread this message to the country at large. What started as a partnership at back of the National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet last year, has grown to a digital playground led by AFI’s top athletes and India’s loved celebrities. We are proud to associate with Milo Home Ground and will encourage people to spread the message of active energy far and wide.”

And #MILOHOMEGROUND won’t leave parents behind! Sports and fitness role-models like Shikhar Dhawan, Mandira Bedi and other celebrities are stepping-up to share their own experiences of MILO® HOME GROUND with their kids. They want to encourage their followers and the community at large to start inculcating physical exercise into the child’s routine with MILO® HOME GROUND – and share their experiences online. For every exercise video that is posted on the MILO® Facebook and Instagram handle (@MiloIndia), the parent will be given a MILO® GREEN CARD to reward their child as appreciation and encouragement for having completed the exercise.

Each MILO® GREEN CARD is a fascinating collectible autographed by a famous athlete. Parents can motivate their kids to collect all 6 MILO® GREEN CARDS:  some exciting surprises await those who earn the entire collection.

So it’s not just MILO’s signature choco-malty taste and nourishing energy that kids can look forward to enjoying, while at home.

The campaign has been created and executed by Meraki Sport & Entertainment, commercial and marketing rights holders of MiloNidjam and marketing partners to the Athletics Federation of India.

Namrata Parekh, Co-founder & Director, Meraki said “While MILO-NIDJAM actively engaged over 65K kids across the country last year, our endeavor with MILO-HOMEGROUND, in 2020, will be to significantly increase reach, whilst simultaneously building brand affinity within the primary target group. To this end, apart from a comprehensive influencer marketing strategy that includes, celebrities, fitness enthusiasts & athletes, we have also partnered with large digital communities, and are in conversations with organizations & institutions who have effectively leveraged the power of sport, as a tool for development & social change.”

AFI Nominates Deserving Neeraj Chopra For Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award,"June 3, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, June 3: Athletics Federation of India has nominated Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medal winning javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. Having captured the attention of athletics fans around the world when he won the crown in the World Junior Athletics Championships in 2016, he has been India’s leading athlete since.

“We are sure that Neeraj will get the nod this time around after he missed out on being picked for the award when weightlifter Mirabai Chanu edged him out in 2018 and wrestler Bajrang Punia was chosen ahead of him last year,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said. “The immensely popular athlete deserves the award for his performances ahead of the 2021 Olympics and it will motivate him to do even better.”

For the Arjuna Award, the AFI panel chaired by Anju Bobby George nominated 2018 Asian Games gold medallists, triple jumper Arpinder Singh and middle-distance specialist Manjit Singh as well as sprinter Dutee Chand, who won two Asian Games silver medals, and middle-distance runner PU Chitra who won gold medals in successive Asian Athletics Championships in 2017 and 2019 besides an Asian Games bronze.

“We believe that Awards selection committee will consider the fact that track and field sport is among the most intensely competed even in the continent. It is also important to remember that in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018, athletics accounted for 20 of 70 medals, including half of 16 gold, won by Indian sportspersons,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair, the only Indian to complete International Coaching Enrichment Certificate Programme by the International Olympic Committee with honors, has been nominated for the prestigious Dronacharya Award. “Radhakrishnan has selflessly hand-held many athletes and coaches over the past few years,” he said.

Kuldip Singh Bhullar, who won the discus throw silver medal in the 1982 Asian Games here, and sprinter Jincy Philip, who was part of the gold medal winning 4x400m relay team in the 2000 Asian Games in Busan, have been nominated for the Dhyan Chand Award, given for lifetime achievement to those who missed out on the Arjuna Award during their sports career.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-nominates-deserving-neeraj-chopra-for-rajiv-gandhi-khel-ratna-award/,Athletics
AFI to identify 600 athletes at MILO NIDJAM for holistic training: Volker Hermann,"November 21, 2019","Tirupati, November 21: The MILO National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet 2019 will be the platform from which the Athletics Federation of India’s plans for the 2028 and 2032 Olympic Games will be launched, AFI High Performance Director Volker Herrmann has said. “With athletes from over 500 districts taking part here, we will some exciting, finding raw talent.”


He said 600 boys and girls would be identified for training, most likely at various academies across the country. “Some of these could go on to represent India in the Olympic Games in 2028 and 2032. We are sure we will have athletes competing in a number of events then,” he said, indicating that a scientific approach would be used to assess the talent.

He said that in addition to their performances, athletes will be assessed on the basis of some tests before they are selected to undergo training. “Besides their physical parameters like height and weight, AFI will test them on the basis of two 20m runs, a long jump and a ball throw,” he said. “These will give us an indication about the abilities of the under-14 and under-16 athletes.”

Volker Herrmann said that the idea is to get all the semifinalists in track events and the finalists in field events to undergo these tests. “Besides, a number of experienced coaches and talent scouts will also nominate some athletes for these tests,” he said. “These athletes are at the right age to be tested for their abilities.”

“We are aware that some of the athletes are able to do well at the youth levels but are unable to replicate that in the senior levels. I believe we can change that by shifting the focus away from early specialisation to a variety of motor-skills,” he said. “I also know that it can happen only with the support of parents and grass-roots coaches.”

The AFI High Performance Director said it was important to help young athletes imbibe the right fundamentals. “It is best to groom a new generation of athletes in a holistic way,” Herrmann said. “Coaches must help athletes do the right things at the right age. I am happy that a number of young Indian coaches are getting themselves ready to do this.”

Neeraj Chopra, IAAF World junior Javelin Throw champion, and World University Games 100m champion Dutee Chand are among those who used earlier NIDJAM editions to showcase their potential. A couple of years ago, Lucknow’s Shailee Singh caught coach Bobby George’s eye and has evolved from a 4.93m long jumper in 2017 to owning the National junior record at 6.15m now.

Given the magnitude of the event, AFI restricts the number of entries from each district to 12 athletes. “It does two things. It not only ensures that there is some form of quality control in that each team will pick the 12 most deserving athletes to travel to Tirupati but also enables the host to plan logistics for a manageable number of athletes and officials,” the AFI President said.

MILO NIDJAM has come a long way from the first edition held in 2003 in Hardiwar and has served as one of the earliest platforms for stars like Neeraj Chopra, Dutee Chand and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon. It is now one of the largest talent search competitions, involving more than 50000 boys and girls in the two age-groups across the country.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MILO-NIDJAM-set-to-host-record-4500-athletes-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/milo-nidjam-set-to-host-record-4500-athletes-from-494-districts/,Athletics
Annu Rani brooks no competition as India’s premier javelin thrower ,"October 10, 2019","Annu Rani brooks no competition as India’s premier javelin thrower

 

AFI Media

Ranchi, October 10: Annu Rani secured an expected victory in the women’s javelin throw event in the 59th National Open Athletics Championships at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium here on Thursday. A measure of her comfortable win can be had from the fact that each of her six throws was better than the best managed by her Railways’ team-mate and rival, Sharmila Kumari.

 

The 25-year-old Annu Rani, who set the National Record at 62.43m in the World Athletics Championships in Doha last month, opened with a throw of 56.97m to make her intentions clear. She followed that up with a series of throws over 55.97, 58.31, 57.29 and 56.86 before securing the title with a 58.60m throw. Sharmila Kumari’s best effort was over 53.28m on her third throw.

 

Meanwhile, Siva S of Services matched his own meet record in the men’s pole vault event with a clearance of 5.10m.

 

ONGC’s Suresh Kuma, 28, returned to the top of the podium in a men’s 10000m race at the national level after five years by winning the event in 29 minutes 41.25 seconds. He had lasted tasted victory in the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Lucknow in June 2014. Asian Championships bronze medallist Murli Kumar Gavit (Gujarat) finished a distant ninth.

 

Earlier, Jinson Johnson (AFI) and Ajay Kumar Saroj (Railways) each won his men’s 1500m heats and set up what could be an interesting final. The two runners were content to finish ahead of the pack in the two heats, nudging ahead of Rahul (Delhi) and Bir Singh (Haryana) by 0.21 seconds and 0.45 seconds respectively.

 

Services’ T Santhosh Kumar, 21, clocked 51.78 seconds to be the most impressive in the men’s 400m Hurdles. MP Jabir (AFI) and Ayyasamy Dharun (Tamil Nadu), who represented India in the World Championships in Doha, were slower but did enough to win their respective heats. The competition among the three of them could produce some fireworks in the final.

 

World University Games champion Dutee Chand emerged the fastest of the qualifiers for the women’s 100m semifinals, clocking 11.55 seconds in the heats. Archana Suseendran, another premier sprinter, got through to the semifinals after finishing third in her heats in 11.87 behind Priyanka Kalagi (Railways) and MV Jilna (Kerala).

 

ONGC’s Siddhanth Thingalaya was the only qualifier for the men’s 110m Hurdles who dipped in under 14 seconds, his time of 13.83 seconds being only six-hundredths of a second slower than the meet record he set back in Kolkata in 2011. If he can sustain his rhythm in the final, he could rewrite that mark.

 

Results:

Men:

10000m: 1. Suresh Kumar (ONGC) 29:25.56; 2. Ranjeet Kumar Patel (Railways) 29:41.35; 3. Bugatha Srinu (Services) 30:03.50.

AFI Media

Ranchi, October 9: The presence of a number of India stars in the 59th National Open Athletics Championships 2019 at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium here is expected to raise the quality of competition. The spotlight will be on javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, sprinters Muhammed Anas Yahiya and VK Vismaya, long jumper Sreeshankar, metric miler Jinson Johnson, woman javelin thrower Annu Rani, sprinter Dutee Chand as well as shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, to name a few.

 

At the start of the new season, leading up to the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year, the meet will be an opportunity for Indian athletes to not only perform well and secure ranking points but also try and match the stiff qualification standards set by the International Association of Athletics Federations.

 

Inevitably, there will be the most interest in tracking Neeraj Chopra’s return to competition. He has not taken part in a championship in more than a year since throwing 83.90m in the Services Athletics Championships in Jalahalli on September 19 last year. He was training in Potchefstroom, South Africa, when it was diagnosed that his elbow injury needed surgery in May last.

 

With the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year being less than 10 months away, Neeraj Chopra’s return will hold the biggest interest among fans. As India’s premier athlete who won gold in the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games last year, the 21-year-old will be keen to show that his rehabilitation has progressed on expected lines.

 

“I really went to get back to the competition mode and since this is the last competition of the season, I want to use this competition to get into that feeling of competition. I had spoken to my doctors and they have said I am okay to compete,”

 

“I am feeling good. Much better now. I started training in Patiala few weeks back and throws are going well in training,” said Neeraj Chopra from Patiala.

 

There is belief that the men and women’s 400m races will be close since those who have been training overseas and competed for India in events like the IAAF World Relay Challenge in Yokohama and the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha. It will also be a chance for others trying to get into the National squad to display their mettle.

 

Meanwhile, the Athletics Federation of India has rejected the entries of 46 athletes, including 37 men and 9 women, who were seeking to represent Manipur despite not belonging to that State. At its annual general meeting in Agra earlier this year, the Federation had warned all States not to encourage such practices.

 

Besides, a number of athletes from Karnataka have been accommodated as AFI entries since the Federation had decided to suspend the Karnataka Athletics Association for delaying the intimation to not host the National Open in Bengaluru due to the non-availability of the Sree Kanteerava Stadium.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-450-720-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/national-open-athletics-in-ranchi-likely-to-see-high-standard-of-competition/,Athletics
AFI names 25-member squad for the IAAF World Championships,"September 9, 2019","New Delhi, September 8: The Athletics Federation of India selection committee on Monday picked a 25-member national team including 16 men and nine women for the IAAF World Championships to be held in Doha, Qatar, from September 27 to October 6. With less than a year to go for the Olympic Games in Tokyo, the well-prepared squad will carry the hopes of the track and field fans of the country.

 

The AFI believes that the 4x400m relay teams will all perform better than they did in the World Relays in Yokohama in May last. “We have invested a lot of time in the 400m runners, getting them to train under renowned coach Galina Bukharina. We believe that the squad has been well prepared to deliver the best results on the World stage,” AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla said.

 

Metric miler Jinson Johnson, who is now training with Coach Scott Simmons in Colarado Springs, United States of America, has caught the eye with his consistency. In the recent months, he improved his own National record in the 1500m twice, first with a time of 3:37.62 in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, on June 15 and then 3:35.24 in Berlin on September 1 to make the grade.

 

Long jumper M Sreeshankar, among the first Indians to attain the IAAF qualifying standard with a leap of 8.20m in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneswar in September last year, has regained form after a heel injury kept him away from the Asian Championships in Doha in April. He recently found the 8.00m mark again and will gain from competing in the big stage.

 

While 400m runner Arokia Rajiv is unavailable due to injury, the selectors decided to discuss the case of javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra who is undergoing rehabilitation programme after an elbow surgery at a later stage.Selection committee also approved the names of sprinters Dutee Chand (100m Women), ArchanaSuseentran (200m Women) and high jumper Tejaswin Shankar subject to invitation from IAAF based on their world rankings. The committee also decided to conduct confirmatory trial for quarter miler Anjali Devi for selection in the team in individual women’s 400m. The trial will be conducted on 21st September 2019 at NS-NIS Patiala. 

 

The AFI selection committee meeting, chaired by Olympian Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, was attended by AFI President AdilleJ Sumariwalla, Chief Coach Bahadur Singh, Bahadur Singh Saggu, Krishna Poonia, Praveen Jolly,UdayPrabhu, Paramjit Singh. Former Chief Coach JS Saini and Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair were special invitees.

 

The team:

 

Men– Jabir MP (400m Hurdles), Jinson Johnson (1500m), Avinash Sable (3000m Steeplechase), KT Irfan and Devender Singh (20km Race Walk), Gopi T (Marathon),Sreeshankar M (Long Jump), Tajinder Pal Singh Toor (Shot Put), Shivpal Singh (Javelin Throw), MuhammedAnas, Nirmal Noah Tom, Alex Antony, Amoj Jacob, KS Jeevan, DharunAyyasamy and Harsh Kumar (4x400m Men’s & MixedRelay).

Karthik Scripts victory over Arpinder Singh in Indian Grand Prix VI,"September 5, 2019","Patiala, September 5: Kerala’s Karthik Unnikrishnan produced a surprise victory over Asian Games gold medallist Arpinder Singh (Punjab) in the Triple Jump event in the Indian Grand Prix – VI at the National Institute of Sports here on Thursday. He scripted a 16.69m effort on his final attempt to seal a victory that appeared possible after two jumps.

The 24-year-old went close to matching his 16.80m effort in the National Inter-State Athletics Championships in Lucknow last week while Arpinder Singh was unable to go past the 16.35m that he managed on his second attempt on Thursday, some distance short of the 16.83m that he delivered in winning at Lucknow.

Neither of them found the rhythm to secure the World Championship qualifying standard (16.95m).

With Alex Antony not having recovered from the hamstring injury that he suffered during the 4x400m relay in Lucknow, the AFI’s top team on Thursday comprised Amoj Jacob, Moah Nirmal Tom, KS Jeevan and Muhammed Anas Yahiya. The quartet managed a winning time of 3:03.68 but the attempt to clock a faster time than the 3:01.85 that India got in the Asian Games last year did not find success.

Similarly, World University Games champion Dutee Chand’s bid to slip under 11.24 seconds did not fructify as she won the 100m dash in 11.43 seconds.

"Avinash Sable, Sreeshankar come up with heart-warming performances on Final Day","August 30, 2019","Lucknow, August 30: Steeplechaser Avinash Sable (Maharashtra) and long jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) warmed up for the IAAF World Athletics Championships with good performances on the closing day of the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Friday.

The 24-year-old Avinash Sable, placed 25th on the IAAF World Rankings, ran at a comfortable pace and yet claimed the meet record with ease, clocking 8:33.19. He could have challenged his own National record (8:28.94) but the humidity was of little help, despite his event being scheduled as the last on the track.

Sreesankar hit sand at 7.83m on his second jump and raised hopes that he would script an 8-metre jump here. The 20-year-old wound himself up for a massive effort when he returned to the runway, showcasing raw energy and speed as he reached the take-off board and landed near that desired mark, but he had disappointingly over-stepped by a little bit to cause the red flag to be raised.

On a day when India’s premier 4x400m men’s team endured disappointment, owing to Alex A Antony stepping out with a muscle pull 200m into the third leg, Tamil Nadu’s women’s sprint quartet held its own by setting the other meet record. Dhana Lakshmi, R Nithya Ramraj, V Revathi and Archana Suseendran combined to finish the 4x100m relay in 45.69 seconds, improving on the 45.96 set by the Kerala team in 1997.

Dutee Chand (Odisha) tried gamely but could not meet the IAAF World Championships qualifying standard in the women’s 100m. She blazed her way to win in 11.38 seconds, 0.14 seconds slower than the target time. Vidya Sagar (Karnataka) emerged the fastest male athlete of the championships edging out Haryana youngster Nuzrat Ali by seven-hundredths of a second.

The gangling Parul Chaudhary outsprinted Sudha Singh on the final lap of the women’s 3000m steeplechase that often saw the lead being exchanged. Her victory helped her completed a double, having won gold in the 5000m on the opening day. Lili Das had done something similar, settling in PU Chitra’s slipstream but sprinting ahead over the final 50m of the women’s 1500m.

Anjali Devi’s 51.53-second sprint sets Track a blaze,"August 29, 2019","AFI Media

 

Lucknow, August 29: Haryana’s Anjali Devi marked her return to competitive racing from rehabilitation from injury with a stunning victory in the women’s 400m in the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Thursday. She clocked a personal best 51.53 seconds, beating SaritabenGayakwad (Gujarat) and Jisna Mathew (Kerala) by a distance.

 

Anjali Devi, who had qualified for the IAAF World Championships as early as in September last year with a 51.79-second showing in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneshwar, showed that a long absence from track did not affect her quest for a quick time. She dipped in under the World Championships qualifying standard on Thursday as well.

 

Considering that no other Indian 400m runner has achieved the qualifying standard of 51.80 seconds, 20-year-old Anjali Devi’s feat on Thursday caught the attention of track and field fans in India. She had been part of the squad that had Spala as its training base but returned home to get her ankle attended to after she was unable to clock impressive times at home in March this year.

 

“Having not run since the Federation Cup (in March), I knew I would have to give my best in the final,” Anjali Devi said. “I am grateful to all those who stood by me when I was getting my ankle treated. The national coaches have been in touch with me and I have trained under coach RohtasSiwach at home before coming here.”

 

Marathon specialist Gopi Thonakal (Kerala) won the grueling 10,000m in 30:52.75, outsprinting Arjun Kumar (Uttar Pradesh) and Vikram Bangriya (Goa). Easily the oldest of the 25 men who took the starter’s orders, Gopi’s victory is creditable when viewed against the fact that as many as 13 runners, including Maharashtra’s Murli Kumar Gavit and KisanTadvi dropped out.

 

With L Suriya opting not to run the women’s 10,000m race and with 5000m winner Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) not entering the event, Phoolan Pal ensured that the distance gold medals would remain with the home State. Phoolan Pal and Karnataka’s Kavita Yadav were engaged in a gritty duel but the Uttar Pradesh runner turned in a good kick in the end.

There was a keen battle at the high jump pit with SarveshKushare (Maharashtra), Geo Jose (Kerala) and B Chethan (Karnataka) finishing within 4cm of one another. For the 24-year-old SarveshKushare, who won the National Open last year at 2.24m, he had to achieve his year’s best height to win gold on Thursday.

 

Chethan sought to lay the gauntlet down by entering the competition only when the bar was raised to 2.10m but when it was set at 2.16, he encountered two failures and though he cleared 2.19m on first attempt, he found 2.21m hard to go over. That left the hard working Geo Jose, who joined the fray at 1.95m, a comfortable winner of the silver medal.

 

World University Games champion Dutee Chand’s presence on the track aroused excitement during the 100m semifinals. She clocked 11.34 seconds and will need to be faster in the final to breach the 11.24-seconds mark that will grant her automatic qualification for the World Championships in Doha next month. Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) won the other semifinal heats in 11.49.

In the men’s 100m semifinals, 19-year-old Nuzrat of Haryana scripted the fastest time of 10.51 seconds. Kiran Bhosale (Maharashtra) was second in that heats in 10.57 and the two of them dragged Vinit Panwar (Manipur) and Rohith (Karnataka) as well into the final as the two fastest runners from among those who did not place first or second in their heats.

Lucknow, August 26: The women’s 200m and the men’s 5000m races could well provide the fireworks on the opening day of the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Tuesday. Though as many as nine finals scheduled for the day, it could be these two events that could hold interest fans of track and field sport the most.

 

Odisha sprinter Dutee Chand’s decision to focus on the 100m will leave the 200m field open for the likes of Tamil Nadu’s ArchanaSuseendran and V Revathi to battle it out with each other for the gold medal onTuesday. It could well be the track event to watch as Archana, the fastest Indian over the distance this year, will lead their bid to stop the clock inside 23.02 seconds and qualify for World Athletics Championship 2019.

 

Archana, who clocked 23.18 seconds in the Indian Grand Prix V in Patiala on August 16 to top Dutee Chand’s 23.24 seconds achieved in the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha on April 24, could face stiff competition from Revathi for the title.

 

Navjeet Kaur Dhillon is likely to draw the most attention when the women’s Discus Throw competition gets under way. The Punjab thrower will be looking to improve on her year’s best show of 57.47m achieved in Doha in April. With Kamalpreet Kaur, the only Indian who has thrown beyond 60m not competing, West Bengal’s Suravi Biswas will have to challenge NavjeetDhillon.

 

Of the two men’s finals scheduled for Tuesday, the 5000m could perhaps be more interesting to watch as a contest. For the entry list boasts of intense competitors like G Lakshmanan (Tamil Nadu) and GavitMurli Kumar (Gujarat), who will both be out to regain their spot in the National camp, and Maharashtra’s KalidasHirave and KisanTadvi.

 

Besides, Uttarakhand had entered marathoner Nitendra Singh Rawat. The presence of Gujarat youngster Ajit Kumar, who is in the development group in the National camp, can spice up proceedings. The women’s race could well be a duel between Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) and L Suriya (Tamil Nadu).

 

For many athletes, this is the last chance to meet the qualifying standards laid down by the IAAF for the World Championships to be held in Doha next month. The meet, originally slated to be held in Kolkata in July, was rescheduled after the West Bengal Athletics Association expressed its inability to host it.

 

Tuesday’s finals:

Men’s: 5000m and Pole Vault.

Women’s; 200m; 5000m; Discus Throw; Hammer Throw; High Jump; and 20km race walk.

Mixed: 4x400m relay.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/event-preview-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/archana-srabani-revathi-could-spark-fireworks-with-a-pacy-200m-on-tuesday/,Athletics
Hon’ble Sports Minister Rijiju unveils Nestle Milo NIDJAM logo,"August 23, 2019","AFI Media

Delhi, 23rd August 2019:In what is a watershed moment in India’s sporting ecosystem, Hon. Minister for Youth Affairs & Sports, Govt. of India, Shri. Kiren Rijiju today unveiled Nestle Milo’s association as a title sponsor to NIDJAM (National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet) – one of the world’s largest talent hunt programmes for a single sport, with over 50,000 young athletes participating in it every year to qualify for the finals.

Speaking at the unveil, Shri. Kiren Rijiju said, “At a time when Government of India under the leadership of Hon. Prime Minister is getting set to launch the game-changing initiative “The Fit India Movement”, it is heartening to know corporate entities are backing a talent hunt initiative that involves young athletes from nearly 500 districts of India. NIDJAM will be a good model for all other disciplines to follow as well. I congratulate the AFI on their good work and I am certain this partnership with Nestle Milo will further strengthen the program and its outcome will be visible to all.”

The initiative is a platform for boys and girls in the Under-14 and Under-16 age groups to showcase their talent across 10 athletics disciplines. NIDJAM in the past has unearthed champions like Neeraj Chopra, Dutee Chand, Navjeet Kaur Dhillon and V Subha.

Present at the unveil was Dr. Narinder Dhruv Batra, President IOA, who congratulated the AFI and wished NIDJAM 2019 success.

AFI President Adille Sumariwalla welcomed Nestle-Milo as the Title Sponsor of the flagship AFI NIDJAM, “It will be right to say that NIDJAM can be an important part of the Fit India Movement that Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports will launch on August 29,” he said.

“We believe Nestle-Milo is a great brand fit and that it will enjoy the partnership with the Federation even as AFI is poised to take track and field sport to new levels in India. This year, we are taking it to newer heights by not only increasing the platform’s reach to over 400 districts, but we will also be extending financial support to over 100 district associations across the country as a way of recognizing and rewarding their hard work. It is a reflection of the positive direction in which AFI has been moving, both in identifying and nurturing talent that makes India proud on international platforms,” he said.”

Starting 2019, talent identified at NIDJAM will be trained and groomed by expert coaches at special National Camps, in partnership with Khelo India with Olympics 2024 & 2028 as milestones.

“Sport is part of MILO’s DNA. As a brand, MILO encourages participation in sports at an early age. We believe that participation in   sports helps  a child imbibe life values & lessons that helps to set his or her strong foundations for the future .As the world’s number 1 cocoa-malt beverage, we are honoured  to partner with NIDJAM – one of the  largest Indian national  sports talent-selection programmes Its a proud moment for Nestle MILO and we are certain  that the collaboration with AFI will strengthen our nations commitment to encourage a healthy and active lifestyle,” said Mr. Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director Nestlé India Ltd.

The association is structured by AFI’s marketing partners Meraki Sport & Entertainment, and commenting on the association, Ajit Ravindran, Managing Director, Meraki said “While on one hand NIDJAM as a platform has been contributing to our nation’s sporting capital for the last 15 years, on the other, Milo’s philosophy is to enable all round development amongst kids, through sport. There couldn’t have been a better value match. We are excited to bring this to fruition and our role will be to drive value to all key stakeholders – AFI, MILO & the platform itself.”

The 2019 edition will be held between the 24th of 26th of November in Andhra Pradesh.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-728-410.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/honble-sports-minister-rijiju-unveils-nestle-milo-nidjam-logo/,Athletics
Sreeshankar’s 8m leap enlivens Indian Grand Prix V in Patiala,"August 16, 2019","AFI Media

Patiala, August 16: Long jumper M Sreeshankar marked his return to competition on Indian soil after six months with a season’s best leap of 8.00m that gave the Indian track and field fans reason for cheer at the Indian Grand Prix V at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here today. He had last competed in India at Sangrur on March 2 and had touched 7.97m in Bishkek last month.

On a very humid evening, Sreeshankar was all pumped up over his first three jumps, hitting soil at 7.95m twice after touching down at 8.00m with his first jump. An uncharacteristic 6.71m was followed by 7.62 and 7.73m efforts. Barring that fourth leap, each of his jumps was farther than his competitors managed today.  

 

The 8.00m effort was only the third time in his nascent career that Sreeshankar leapt over eight metres or more, having jumped 8.11m and 8.20m in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneshwar to wrest the National record from Ankit Sharma. A heel injury kept the 20-year-old away from the track largely until June when he went to Europe for four competitions.

 

“I have not competed much after coming back from injury. I am happy to hit 8-meter mark again but I need to improve it further,” said Sreeshankar after the competition.

 

Karnataka’s Siddharth Naik was second with 7.56m, edging out Haryana’s Sahil Mahabali by a mere centimeter.

 

Shot putter Inderjeet Singh looked determined to go past the 20m mark – the World Championship qualifying is pegged at 20.70m – when he opened with a season’s best 19.51m. Yet, despite a good string of four throws in excess of 19m, his opening effort remained his best He fouled his last two attempts and will have to quality at the National Inter-State Championships later this month.

 

Archana Suseentran (Tamil Nadu) gave the 200m sprint her best and won the two-woman race in a career best time of 23.18 seconds but could not meet the World Championship qualification standard (23.02 seconds). Having finished second behind Dutee Chand in the 100m, she returned to the track determined to make the half-lapper one to remember.

 

With Hina getting left behind quite early in the race, the 25-year-old Archana had to focus on racing against the clock. The result was a dramatic improvement in her personal best from 24.03 seconds in January 2017 to 23.18 seconds.

 

Her last 200m sprint at the National level was in the National Open in Chennai on September 28, 2017. Last year, she took part in one race over the distance in the Tamil Nadu State Championship but spent much time focusing on the short sprint so that she could be part of the Indian 4x100m relay team in the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha earlier this year.

In the men’s 400m hurdles, Vijay Singh Mallik (Services) breached the 51-second barrier for only the second time in his career, clocking 50.99 seconds as he finished second behind Tamilarasan Santhosh Kumar (Tamil Nadu) by four-hundredths of a second and ahead of the seasoned Jithin Paul (Kerala).

 

The 26-year-old Malik, who had clocked a personal best of 50.15 seconds in the Services Championships in September last year, has been training in Patiala while the sub-50-second hurdlers, Santhosh Kumar, 21, and Jithin Paul, 29, have been based in Spala, Poland for some time now.

AFI to extend financial support to 100 districts to boost track and field sport,"August 2, 2019","AFI Media

New Delhi, August 2: In a landmark decision, aimed at galvanising track and field sport at the grass-roots level, the Athletics Federation of India has decided to provide grants to 100 Districts Athletics Associations in recognition of their consistent good work to promote athletics in their area and compete in the National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet (NIDJAM) each year.

AFI President AdilleSumariwalla said this would be a pilot project this year and would be extended to more districts in a couple of years. “We have always encouraged and recognised work at the grass-roots level, and we believe that this would be the first time a National Sports Federation is providing grants to district associations,” he said.

Mr. Sumariwalla said the Federation was confident that the move to provide grants to district associations would come a fillip to track and field sport at the bottom of the pyramid. “We know that we have to broaden the base to be able to find the talent that can be nurtured to passionately pursue Olympian dreams,” he said.

The AFI President said the idea had the support of the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports’ Khelo India programme. “We met the Ministry and Sports Authority of Indian officials a few weeks ago to finalise the modalities of this game-changing move,” Mr. Sumariwalla said. AFI has already initiated the process of identifying the 100 districts to be provided financial support this year.

AFI believes that this move will inspire the State Associations to streamline themselves better. At the recent annual general meeting of the Federation, officials State Associations were told in clear terms to shape up or ship out. AFI also encouraged youngsters from the districts to take up and complete the IAAF Coaches Education and Certification Level 1 programme.

All districts will conduct their championships ahead of the 17th NIDJAM for under-16 and under-14 boys and girls which will be held from November 24. The Federation is planning a meeting with the presidents and secretaries of close to 500 districts to share details of the AFI development programme and motivate them to make athletics more popular in their respective districts.

It may be mentioned that some of India’s brightest athletics stars like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra (2012) and sprinter Dutee Chand (2011) as well as discus thrower Navjeet Kaur Dhillon(2010) and 400m runner V Subha (2014) are among those who cut their teeth in the earlier editions of NIDJAM.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nidjam-photo-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-to-extend-financial-support-to-100-districts-to-boost-track-and-field-sport/,Athletics
Chithra’s repeat 1500m gold marks India 17-medal finish,"April 25, 2019","AFI Media

Doha, April 24: PU Chithra struck gold in the women’s 1500m, there were two silver medals through Ajay Kumar Saroj (men’s 1500m) and the women’s 4x400m relay team as well as a women’s 200m bronze for Dutee Chand as India finished with 17 medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze) in the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships here on Wednesday.

There was disappointment as the Indian men’s 4x400m team of Kunhu Mohammed, KS Jeevan, Muhammed Anas Yahiya and Arokia Rajiv, which had finished second in 3:03.28 was disqualified under rule 163.2 (causing impediment to an athlete by jostling or obstructing).  Arokia Rajiv moved up from third place at the start of the anchor leg with an explosive effort, but in vain.

The day has started with Chithra winning gold. “After losing to the Bahrainis in the Asian Games in Jakarta, I was keen to get some revenge. I am happy I made it in a slow-paced race and defended by 2017 title,” Chithra said after winning in 4:14.56. Of course, her time was slower than the season’s best of 4:13.58 but it was led by simple tactics of being with the Bahrain duo and sprinting past them in the final lap.

Kazakhstan’s Tatyana Neroznak set the early pace, but it was Gashwaw Tigest who controlled the race after the first lap. With 300m left, she was still in the lead while Winfred Mutile Yavi, attempting a treble crown after winning the 5000m and 3000m steeplechase, was not too far behind with the Indian on her heels.

Chithra started her kick midway through the back straight on the last lap and slipped past Winfred Yavi on the bend and then set herself up to pass Gashaw Tigest on the outside on the final home straight. The Bahraini tried hard to keep the Asian Games bronze medallist at bay, but without success as the 23-year-old pushed on relentlessly to retain gold.

The photo-finish camera was needed to separate Ajay Kumar Saroj from Qatar’s Musaab Ali and get him the men’s 1500m silver medal behind Abraham Kipchirchir Rotich (Bahrain). The Indian was credited with a time of 3:43.18 and six-thousands of a second ahead of the Qatar runner. Ajay Saroj, who won gold in Bhubaneswar in 2017, came up with a stirring run on the home stretch.

It was the second time that the photo-finish cameras favoured India on Wednesday evening. Sprinter Dutee Chand endured a fairly long wait after sustaining her pace over 200m while several others slowed down after expending energy over the first 100m and more. She took bronze in 23.24 seconds, edging out Bahrain’s Edidiong Odiong by one-thousandth of a second.

Salwa Naser (Bahrain) completed a 200-400m double with a championship record time of 22.74 seconds, showing Kazakhstan’s Olga Safronova a clean pair of heels. It was the second time in three nights that she took Sri Lankan sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe’s record, having claimed the 400m mark on Monday.

Gavit Murli Kumar came up with a personal best time of 13:48.99 in the men’s 5000m where he finished fifth but it does not reflect the gallant effort that he made along with Abhishek Pal for a large part of the race. Bahrain’s Birhanu Balew and Albert Rop were easy winners of gold and silver and Murli gave up after he was passed by Japan’s Hiroki Matsueda over the last 300m.

Without Hima Das, the Indian women’s 4x400m quartet finished with silver in 3:32.21 despite a terrific third leg (52.99 seconds) by Saritaben Gayakwad. Prachi, MR Poovamma and Saritaben Gayakwad could not give VR Vismaya enough lead and she could not stave off a surge by Salwa Naser (Bahrain) on the anchor leg.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chitra-repeats-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/chithras-repeat-1500m-gold-marks-india-17-medal-finish/,Athletics
Swapna Barman adds heptathlon silver to India’s medal haul,"April 23, 2019","Swapna Barman adds heptathlon silver to India’s medal haul

AFI Media

Doha, April 22: Swapna Barman secured the heptathlon silver medal with 5993 points in the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships at the Khalifa Stadium here on Tuesday to take India’s medal haul to 11. Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor had picked up India’s second gold medal late on Monday evening.

The 22-year-old Swapna Barman found it hard to bridge the gap that she had conceded to 2015 champion Ekaterina Vornina (Uzbekistan) on the first day after the shot put despite chalking up a personal best of 12.76. She made a game bid at the long jump pit by being the only one to go past the 6m mark but her 6.01m effort was worth only 49 points more than the Uzbek’s 5.85m jump.

Purnima Hembram, the other Indian hepathlete in the fray, could not recover from a disappointing 11.58m-effort at the shot-put circle and trailed in the fifth place with 5529 points. She had a good 5.99m show at the long jump pit but a 39.70m javelin throw gave her poor returns and she could not get in the medal reckoning.

India’s new-look women’s 4x100m relay team of Archana Suseendran, Veeramani Revathi, Kunnath Ranga and Dutee Chand clocked 43.81 seconds, an improvement over the 44.12 clocked in the confirmatory trials in Patiala on April 13, and yet finished fourth behind China, Kazakhstan and Bahrain. Only two-tenths of a second separated the Indian team from a podium finish.

Dutee Chand recovered from the disappointment of not winning a medal in the women’s 100m to post a reasonably quick 23.33 seconds time in finishing ahead of the pack in the 200m semifinal heats. She rallied over the last 50m to push China’s Kong Lingwei to second place.

Looking for a 200-400 double, Bahrain’s Salwa Naser broke Sri Lankan Susanthika Jayasinghe’s championship record of 22, set in Colombo in 2002, with a time of 22.84 seconds. The 100m winner Ogla Safronova clocked 22.98 seconds to be the second fastest qualifier ahead of Dutee Chand.

Ajay Kumar Saroj showed a good turn of speed after the bell to qualify for the men’s 1500m final in a time of 3:49.20. Running well within himself over 1100m, he moved up from seventh to look like winning the faster of the two semifinal heats but eased up in the final 10m for Bahrain’s Mohamed Ayoub Tiouali to sneak ahead. Jinson Johnson did not start, owing a calf muscle injury.

Parul Chaudhary clocked a personal best time of 10:03.43 to finish a creditable fifth in the women’s 3000m steeplechase.

On Monday evening, Tajinderpal Singh Toor gave India its second gold medal with a 20.22m throw to top the men’s shot-put competition. Going in as favourite, the Asian Games champion handled the pressure well with a series of good throws. He was looking for a 21m throw but had to settle for five throws in the 19m range.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/swapna-asian-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/swapna-barman-adds-heptathlon-silver-to-indias-medal-haul/,Athletics

AFI Media

Doha, April 21: Annu Rani claimed the women’s javelin throw silver medal in the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships with a throw of 60.22m at the Khalifa Stadium here today. Distance runner Parul Chaudhary had opened India’s medal hunt with a bronze in the women’s 5000m, slipping past a tiring compatriot Sanjivani Jadhav in the final lap of the gruelling race.

Parul Chaudhary settled to a comfortable pace, unmindful of the leading trio pulling away midway through the race and, drawing on her experience of running marathons to gain ground on Sanjivani Jadhav steadily. She finished with her personal best of 15:36.03, a significant improvement on the 15:58.35 she clocked in Patiala last month.

“I did not worry about the leaders stepping up the pace. I ran according to plan and how my body felt,” the 24-year-old Parul Chaudhary said. Sanjivani Jadhav’s 15:41.12 was her season’s best. She was disappointed at not been able to shadow the Bahrain runners Winfred Mutile Yavi and Bontu Rebitu till the finish.

Annu Rani focused on doing well in the competition, not letting her mind go back to the time she threw a disappointing 53.93m in the Asian Games in Jakarta. Her opening throw went past the 60m mark even though she was conservative in throwing from well behind the line. It was good enough to get silver tonight. Her team-mate Sharmila Kumari was seventh with a best of 54.48m.

“I was keen on doing well this evening. I knew I had trained well for the event,” Annu Rani, 26, said. Her second throw of 58.86m and a fourth of 56.56m would have got her silver. “I was pumped up and would have got my career best today had I not thrown from far behind the line.”

China’s Lyu Huihui set a new Championship record with her opening throw of 64.92 and raised it to 65.83m to be a clear winner of gold medal.

The two medals came as a boost to the Indian contingent that was downcast after Hima Das pulled with a back injury halfway through her 400m heats in the morning. The young Indian slowed down near the 180m mark and then clutched her lower back as she felt pain due to spasms. She then lay sprawled on the track as the other runners sped away.

The morning session also had some wonderful news for India as Dutee Chand clocked a National record time of 11.28 seconds in the women’s 100m dash, MR Poovamma came up with a season’s best time of 52.46 seconds in finishing second in her 400m semifinal heats behind title favourite Salwa Naser (Bahrain).

In the two-lap race, Gomathi Marimuthu ensured that there would be an Indian representation in the final as she came home in 2:04.96 in the fast first semifinal heats. Twinkle Chaudhary made a game attempt to catch up with the leaders by straining every sinew in the second semifinal heats but finished fourth in 2:07.00 and missed a berth in the final.

India’s men’s 400m and 800m runners advanced to the semifinals as well. Arokia Rajiv won his first round heats in 46.25 seconds while Muhammad Anas Yahiya did enough to finish third in his heats in 46.36 seconds and assure himself of a semifinal spot. Jinson Johnson (1:53.43) and Mohammed Afsal (1:52.93) advanced to the 800m semifinals.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/annu-rani-asian-athletics-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/annu-rani-claims-javelin-silver-parul-chaudhary-gets-5000m-bronze/,Athletics

"PREVIEW: Vismaya favorite in 400m, Jinson set for comeback in 1500m","March 13, 2019","AFI Media
13/03/2019

New Delhi. Indian Grand Prix winner VK Vismaya will lead a strong field in the women’s 400 metres event at the 23rd senior Federation Cup Athletics Championships in Patiala. The country’s most prestigious athletics competition will be held at the National Institute of Sport from March 15-18, 2019.

Hima Das, the Asian Games silver medallist and the World junior gold medallist will be a part of a strong field, which includes the likes of Poovamma MR, SaritabenGayakwad, Jisna Mathews, Sonia Baishya and Anjali Devi. All the members of the 4X400 metres relay will be participating in the 400 metres heats, which will take place on Sunday, March 17 at 9.40 am.

The Fed Cup will also be the final opportunity for Indian athletes to qualify for the 23rd Asian Athletics Championships to be held in Doha from April 21-24.

“We expect roughly the same number of medals as that from last Asian Championships held in Bhubaneswar in 2017, about 30. In Patiala, we don’t expect the same performance from Hima Das as her last year’s show at the Fed Cup. She has been busy with her exams and that has hampered her preparations. We expect that the women’s 400 metres will be an exciting contest, apart from the men’s 800 and 1500 metres,” said Athletics Federation of India official RK Radhakrishnan.

The men’s equivalent of the quarter-mile will also witness steep competition, with triple silver medallist from Jakarta, Muhammad Anas Yahiya, leading the pack.

Anas, who also holds the National Record, will be joined by Arokia Rajiv, Sachin Roby, Muhammad Kunhu and 400 metres hurdles national record holder AyyasamyDharun.

Silver medallist in the 100 and 200 metres at Jakarta, Dutee Chand, will also be the star attraction in the same events at the Fed Cup. Dutee will also likely face off against Hima Das in the 200 metres event. Amiya Kumar Mullick and VK ElakkiyaDasan are among the favourites in the men’s 100 and 200 metres.

The men’s 1500 metres event will witness an interesting three-way contest between Jinson Johnson, Manjit Singh and Asian Athletics Championships gold medallist Ajay Kumar Saroj. Johnson, having pipped to the 800 metres title in Jakarta by Manjit, will compete against him in the same event at the Fed Cup.

The women’s 1500 metres will see upcoming stars Lili Das and PU Chitra try to out-do each other. Maharashtra’s ArchanaAdhav will also provide strong competition to the two runners.

Gold medallist in Asian Championships in 2017, Govindan Lakshmanan will participate in the long distance double of 5000 and the 10000 metres.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/15-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/preview-vismaya-favorite-in-400m-jinson-set-for-comeback-in-1500m/,Athletics
"Narale, Bamhane impress on final day of 34th National Junior Athletics","November 5, 2018","AFI Media

05 November 2018

Ranchi: India’s young athletes continued to impress with several meet records falling on the final day of the four day long 34th Junior National Athletics Championships that concluded at the Birsa Munda Athletics Stadium in Ranchi on Monday.

Avantika Narale of Maharashtra wrote her name into the record books with a new meet record in the U-16 girls 200m sprint. Narale, a 15-year-old from Lonkar High School, Pune, stormed past the rest of her field to claim gold with an impressive time of 24.96 seconds. Narale pipped to the post Jeevanji Deepthi of Telengana who clocked 25.09 seconds. Upcoming 14-year-old Shaili Srivastava claimed the bronze medal for Uttar Pradesh with a time of 25.60 seconds.

Narale is no stranger to the track, having won a gold medal in the 100m sprint at the Khelo India School Games earlier this year. In Ranchi, Narale shaved .02 seconds off the previously existing meet record of 24.98 seconds set by Asian Games silver medalist Dutee Chand nine years ago at the Warrangal edition of the Junior National Championships in 2009.

Another sprint meet record was set by Nisar Ahmed of Delhi in the U-18 boys 200m race. Ahmed who clinched the gold medal with a time of 21.50 seconds. Ahmed who first broke into the headlines when he set a U-16 record last year, added another mark to his name on Monday. Ahmed erased the existing record of 21.59 seconds set by Jijin Vijayan of Kerala in 2011. The national mark of 21.33 seconds stands in the name of Amiya Malik.

Ahmed soundly beat out Shanmuga Srinivasa of Andhra Pradesh who clocked 21.73 seconds while Kerala athlete Abhinav took the final step of the podium with a time of 21.87 seconds. To put Ahmed’s effort into perspective, his time of 21.50 seconds was .16 faster than that posted by Amit Kumar Yadav of Uttar Pradesh (21.66 seconds) who claimed the gold medal in the 200m race for U-20 men’s runners in the same Championships.

Rising middle distance runner Tai Bamhane also rewrote a meet record in her name over the course of winning the girls U-16 800m race. Bamhane, chugged home to the finish line with a time of 2.12.85 seconds to ease past the previous meet record of 2.13.00 seconds set by Chinchu Jose nearly 12 years ago at the 2006 Junior National Championships in Bangalore.

Tai Bamhane – a Warli tribal from western Maharashtra who studies in the Marathi-medium Vidyaprabodhini Prashala in Nashik stayed well ahead of her rivals – running the two-lapper with the assurance and fearlessness of a far more seasoned runner. Bamhane finished nearly five seconds clear of Donthu Bhagya Lakshmi who clocked 2.17.79 seconds. The bronze medal was won by Uttarakhand athlete Anisha who stopped the clock in 2.18.37 seconds.

Despite not securing a mark of her own, Kerala’s Abitha Mary Manuel came in with a strong display in the U-20 Women’s 800m race. Manuel clinched the gold medal with a time of 2.09.43 seconds. The record Manuel, a youth Commonwealth Games bronze medalist, missed out on was that of Tintu Luka who had clocked 2.07.48 seconds at the Mysore Junior National Championships in 2009. However Manuel was far faster than the rest of her field on Monday. She finished nearly three seconds ahead of Haryana athlete Sunil Kumari who clocked 2.12.38 seconds. Delhi runner Ankita Chahal came in third with a time of 2.12.73 seconds.

29 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Swapna Barman won the first-ever Asian Games gold for India in the women’s heptathlon event in Jakarta on Wednesday. The 21-year old wrapped up the title by finishing the 800 metres race in a time of 2:21.13. Barman finished with 6026 points, an overall best for her, beating the 5942 points at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar in 2017 last year.

In the morning, Barman had topped the Javelin Throw event by throwing 50.63 metres, adding third personal best to her collection and put some distance between herself and her rivals. Purnima Hembram, the other Indian in the event came fourth overall with 5837 points.

Earlier, Arpinder Singh won the men’s Triple Jump competition with an attempt of 16.77 metres. Arpinder, who had finished fifth in Incheon in 2014, set the mark on his 3rd attempt, to take the title. He also became the first man in 48 years since Mohinder Singh Gill (1970) to win the Triple Jump title at the Asian Games.

Arpinder, the Federation Cup champion, had also made the 3rd highest jump of the competition with his second attempt of 16.58 metres. Rakesh Babu, also competing in the final jumped 16.40 metres to finish sixth in the final.

Dutee Chand became only the 4th Indian to win a medal in the 100 and 200 metres, as she followed up her silver in the 100 with another in the 200. Chand, courtesy of her second silver, became the first Indian since PT Usha in 1986 to win a medal in both the 100 and 200.

The 800 metres gold medallist, Manjit Singh stayed on course for a middle distance double as he topped his heat in the 1500 metres. The silver medallist in the half-mile, Jinson Johnson, also qualified for the final as he was second in the other heat.

The Indian men’s 4×400 relay team also qualified for the final as the quartet of Kunhu Mohammed, Jeevan KS, Jithu Baby and Dharun Ayyasamy finished second in their heat with a time of 3:06.48, finishing behind Japan.

India also lost their appeal against an infringement by Bahrain in the 4×400 metres mixed relay.

Manjit becomes first man in 36 years to win 800m gold at Asiad,"August 28, 2018","AFI Media
28 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Manjit Singh became the first Indian man in 36 years to win gold in the 800 metres at the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang.

Singh, who was a 2010 Commonwealth Games semifinalist and a runner-up at the 2018 Federation Cup and Inter-State Championships, won the race in a time of 1:46.15 seconds, finishing ahead of fellow countryman and favorite Jinson Johnson.

Johnson, the national record holder in the 800 metres, having broken Sriram Singh’s 42-year-old mark had pipped Manjit to two domestic titles this year, won the silver medal clocking 1:46.35. This was the first instance of India winning the gold and silver medals in the men’s 800 metres since the inaugural Asiad in New Delhi in 1951.

India’s mixed relay team managed to win a silver medal in the newly introduced 4X400 metres event. The team, comprising of Muhammed Anas, MR Poovamma, Hima Das and Arokia Rajiv finished in a time of 3:15.71. India had opted for a ‘man-woman-woman-man’ formation in the mixed relay, Anas going first followed by Poovamma and Hima as Arokia Rajiv went last.

The Athletics Federation of India have lodged a protest, alleging that Hima Das’ handover was obstructed by a Bahraini runner. A jury will deliberate on this appeal and the results of the appeal are expected by 10 am tomorrow.

Dutee Chand, looking to follow up on her silver medal in the 100 metres, qualified for the final of the women’s 200 metres with a time of 23.00 seconds. Hima Das, in the first semifinal, was disqualified after she jumped the starting gun and was charged with a false start.

Earlier, both women had come through the heats of the competition, Dutee winning her Heat with a time of 23.37 seconds while Hima had qualified as one of the fastest lucky losers, finishing with a time of 23.47 seconds.

At the end of four events in the heptathlon, Swapna Barman currently lies second with 3481 points, 32 behind the leader Wang Qingling of China. Barman, who was in discomfort due to a tooth ache, was brave in competition despite the pain. Purnima Hembram is a further 67 points behind in third place, with 3 events to go.

Annu Rani finished 6th in the women’s Javelin Throw final, as she could muster a highest attempt of 53.93 metres. Rani fouled her final three throws to finish short of the medal places.

In the women’s 5000 metres, Suriya Loganathan was fifth with a time of 15:49.30, behind winner Kalkidan Befkadu of Bahrain.

"Asian Games 2018: Toor breaks Games record, India bags first gold in athletics","August 25, 2018","AFI Media
25 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Tajinder Pal Singh Toor stormed his way to Asian Games gold as the 23-year old shot put thrower from Punjab set a new national record and Asian Games record with a throw of 20.75 metres.

The national record, which previously belonged to Om Prakash Karhana with 20.69 metres was shattered by the left-handed Toor on his fifth attempt. Tajinder had earlier taken the lead with his first attempt of 19.96 metres.

His personal best was 20.40 metres which he had set at the Federation Cup in Patiala in 2017, but there was no stopping Tajinder here as he managed a 20 metre throw in his sixth and final attempt.

He was joined in celebration by his coach Mohinder Singh Dhillon as shot put gave India its ninth gold at the Asiad, making it the most successful discipline for India. Men’s Shot Put has now contributed 19 medals in total, including 3 silver and 7 bronze medals.

Tajinder wasn’t the only Indian athlete to set a new national record, as Hima Das also set a new national record in the women’s 400 metres. The quarter-miler from Assam managed a time of 51 seconds in Heat 1 as she finished second behind Bahrain’s Salwa Eid Naser, who topped qualification overall with a time of 50.86 s, a new Games record.

Hima broke the record of Manjeet Kaur, set in 2004 by 0.05 seconds. Joining Hima in the semi-finals of the 400 metres was Nirmala Sheoran, who also won her Heat, the third, with a time of 54.09 seconds.

The male quarter-milers also did not disappoint as Muhammad Anas, who came fourth in the Commonwealth Games, won the second semi-final with a time of 45.30 seconds, making him the fastest qualifier.

Arokia Rajiv, who won a bronze in Incheon 4 years ago, was second fastest in the 1st semi-final with a time of 46.08 seconds. Earlier, Anas had won his Heat in the morning, running 45.63 seconds. Arokia had run 46.82 seconds in Heat 4.

Dutee Chand also won her 100 metres Heat with a time of 11.38 seconds, holding off the challenge of Olga Safronova. Chand qualified third fastest overall and will now run in the first semi-final.

Sreeshankar Murali, in his first major international competition, also did well in the Long Jump qualifiers, managing 7.83 metres in his first jump. That attempt was enough for the 19-year old Federation Cup champion to cross the automatic qualification mark of 7.80 seconds and qualify for the final.

Balasubramanya Chethan, India’s entrant in the High Jump competition, did not disappoint, as he cleared 2.15 metres on his second attempt at the height to book a place in the final.

Sarita Singh finished fifth in the Women’s Hammer Throw, with a best attempt of 62.03 metres on her third throw. It was a good performance by the national record holder in a highly competitive field.

Suriya Loganathan and Sanjivani Jadhav finished sixth and ninth respectively in the women’s 10000 metres.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Asian-Games-2018-Toor-breaks-Games-record-India-bags-first-gold-in-athletics.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/asian-games-2018-toor-breaks-games-record-india-bags-first-gold-in-athletics/,Athletics
"Dhanvir, Vishnu Priya set meet records on final day of Youth Nationals","July 23, 2018","AFI Media
23 July 2018

Vadodara. Punjab shot-putter Dhanvir Singh and Kerala hurdler Vishnu Priya wrote themselves into the record books on the final day of the 15th National Youth Athletics championships as they registered meet records in the men’s shotput and women’s 400m hurdles respectively.

Dhanvir Singh had begun his event on a very strong note, erasing the earlier meet record of 19.34m set by Navtejdeep Singh in 2011 with his very first throw of the competition. Singh started with a throw of 19.66m, before improving that mark and setting the new meet record of 19.69m on his fifth throw of the competition. Such was Singh’s dominance in the competition that he made four efforts over 19m while none of his competitors could cross that figure even once. He would make an effort to improve on his meet record in his final attempt but only managed a throw of 18.89m.

Even that though would have been enough to win a gold medal. The silver medal in the competition was claimed by Adish Ghildiyal of Uttarakhand who recorded a best effort of 18.23m in his fifth throw of the competition. Ghildiyal, the national U-16 record holder was not in his best form as he registered only two clean throws in the competition. The bronze medal in the competition was claimed by Aniket Kala of Uttarakhand who had a best effort of 17.98m.

The women’s 400m hurdles were similarly one sided in favour of J Vishnu Priya. The 17-year-old athlete from Kerala crossed the finish line in a season’s best time of 1:02.52 seconds. In doing so, she erased the previous meet record of 1:02.58 seconds set by PO Sanya in Bambolim in 2015. Priya was far ahead of the field with the silver medallist trailing nearly three seconds behind. The medal was won by Karnataka’s K Prajna who clocked 1:05.08 seconds. The third step on the podium went to Jyoshna Sabar of Odisha who clocked 1:05.82 seconds.

Another athlete coming close to a meet record was Kerala’s Ancy Sojan. The 17-year-old clocked 24.91 seconds in the final of the women’s 200m race. Although it was shy of Dutee Chand’s meet record of 24.49seconds recorded in 2012, Sojan had the disadvantage of having to run the semifinals of the 200m in the morning. Sojan still managed to improve on her semifinal timing of 24.95 seconds in the final. The silver medal in the competition was taken by Kirti Bhoite who clocked 25.42 seconds. The bronze medal went to Giridharani of Tamil Nadu who clocked 25.50 seconds.

Meanwhile Sandra Babu earned her second gold medal in the jumps competition at the Manjalpur Sports Complex in three days. The 17-year-old from Kerala added the triple jump gold medal to the long jump gold she had won on Saturday. Babu cleared a distance of 12.51m to get the better of Tamil Nadu’s J Coleshiya who had a best jump of 12.24m. The bronze medal went to Maharashtra’s Sharvari Parulekar who made a successful jump of 11.16m.

It was a double silver medal for sprinter Karan Hegiste. The 16-year-old from Maharashtra had won a silver medal in the men’s 100m competition on Sunday evening and he added another silver in the men’s 200m on Monday. Hegiste clocked 22.28 seconds to finish behind Karnataka’s VA Shashikanth who crossed the finish line in 22.16 seconds. The bronze medal went to Ashish of Chandigarh who clocked 22.30seconds.

Dhanvir, winner of boys shot put event, and Aparna Roy, winner of girls 100m hurdles gold medal was declared as the ‘best athletes’ of the meet. The overall team championships title went to Haryana (165pts) while Kerala finished as runner-up with 150points.

Guwahati. Hima Das claimed the bragging rights on the final day of the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships by winning the marquee women’s 400m race in Guwahati on Friday.

The 18-year-old clocked 51.13 seconds to pip Haryana’s Nirmla Sheoran to the top of the podium at the Indira Gandhi Stadium.

Das, who had earlier won the 200m appeared to be in trouble with Sheoran having opened up a sizable lead at the final bend. Yet Das, running in lane 5 powered through the final stretch to catch up with Sheoran, running in lane 3, before pulling ahead in the final few meters of the race. Das’ time was a new personal best for her. Her previous best was a time of 51.32 seconds, that had seen her finish sixth at the Commonwealth Games. Das also set a new meet record, erasing the previous mark of 51.48 seconds set by Sheoran at the 2016 edition of the Championships. Sheoran meanwhile clocked 51.25m, just .03 seconds off her own personal best of 51.22 seconds. Prachi of Uttar Pradesh came third with a time of 52.96 seconds.

Other sprinters who crossed the qualifying standards set by AFI for Asian Games were Dutee Chand, in the women’s 100m and men’s 400m athlete Arokia Rajiv. Chand booked her spot for the quadrennial event in the morning session itself. Competing in the semifinal of her event, the 22-year-old from Odisha set the track ablaze with a new national record of 11.29 seconds. The AFI’s qualification guideline stood at 11.67 seconds. Chand erased the old national mark, which was also her previous personal best of 11.30 seconds set in New Delhi last year. Chand though couldn’t improve on her national record in the finals of the 100m, although her time of 11.32 seconds was more than enough to take gold. Finishing behind Chand was K Ranga of Manipur who clocked a credible 11.70 seconds while Karnataka’s Reena George claimed bronze with 11.77 seconds.

Arokia Rajiv meanwhile clocked a solid 45.78 seconds to finish under the AFI standard of 46.04 seconds. The 27-year-old from Tamil Nadu finished ahead of Kerala’s Kunhu Muhammad, who clocked 46.30 seconds and Karnataka’s Jeevan KS who took bronze with a time of 46.37 seconds.

Creating some happy headaches for the selectors were the top four athletes in the women’s 1500m, who all recorded times faster than the Asian Games qualifying standard of 4:16.88 seconds. PU Chitra of Kerala claimed the gold medal in 4:11.55 seconds, closely followed by 19-year-old Monika Choudhary of Uttar Pradesh who stopped the watch at 4:12.44 seconds. Jhuma Khatun of Uttar Pradesh claimed bronze with a time of 4:12.84 seconds while West Bengal’s Lili Das also finished inside the Asian Games standard with a time of 4:13.12 seconds.

Two more athletes would manage to clear the AFI’s qualification standards in the men’s triple jump. Arpinder Singh, cleared 17m after a gap of four years, winning the event with a jump of 17.09m. Also managing to get the better of the Asian Games standard of 16.62m was Kerala’s Rakesh Babu who cleared 16.63m to finish second. Mohamad Salahu of Tamil Nadu took bronze with a best effort of 16.32m.

Two heptathletes also managed to earn a call up for the Asian Games. With the qualifying standard set at 5400 points, Odisha’s Purnima Hembram, who took gold in Guwahati with 5898 points and West Bengal’s Swapna Barman who claimed a silver with a total of 5725 points managed to book their passage to Jakarta. Falling just short by six points was M Sowmya of Andhra Pradesh who tallied 5394 points.

There would be a touch of nerves for Jinson Johnson as he fell just short of the AFI guidelines in the men’s 1500 event. Johnson who broke the 42-year-old Indian record in the 800m just a couple of days ago, claimed gold in the 1500m with a time of 3:45.12 seconds. Johnson was just .12 seconds off the Asian Games standard of 3:45.00 seconds. Johnson finished ahead of Manjit Singh of Haryana who clocked 3:46.08 and Asian Championship gold medalist Ajay Kumar Saroj who clocked 3:46.91 seconds.

The selection committee will meet at 5pm tomorrow at AFI headquarters in Delhi to select the Indian team for the Asian Games 2018.

Guwahati. Meet records continued to tumble and athletes continued to earn places in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games, at the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati. Five athletes earned the right to represent India in Jakarta even as six meet records were set in the third day of competition at Guwahati’s Indira Gandhi stadium.

Javelin thrower Shiv Pal Singh became the latest Indian entrant to the 80m + club, winning a gold medal in the event at the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships in Guwahati with a throw of 82.28m. The qualification guideline for the Asian Games was set at 81m by the Athletics Federation of India. The 23-year-old athlete from Uttar Pradesh also shattered the old meet record of 79.67m set by Jagdish Bishnoi in 2000.

Singh was trailing in second place with a best effort of 78.11m before flinging the spear to a personal best mark with his final throw of the competition. He beat out former national record holder Rajender Singh who settled for silver with a throw of 80.63m. Claiming bronze was Uttar Pradesh’s Amit Kumar who had been leading until the final round of throws, with a throw of 78.17m.

Also crossing the qualification guidelines for Asian Games was steeplechaser Sudha Singh. The former national record holder clocked 9.39.59 seconds to both erase her own old meet record of 9:45.60 seconds set in 2013 and also finish under the Asian Games qualifying standard of 9:45.00 seconds. Sudha was the comfortable winner at the Indira Gandhi Stadium, finishing more than 15 seconds clear of second place Chinta Yadav who clocked 9:55.41 seconds. Chavi Yadav made it an all Uttar Pradesh podium, becoming only the fourth Indian woman to finish inside 10 minutes, with a time of 9:56.73 seconds. The race would however prove to be disappointing for national record holder Lalita Babar who was making her return to competition after a year off the track. While Babar had been expected to resume her rivalry with Singh, she would fail to complete the race.

The men’s 3000m steeplechase event would also see an athlete earn the chance to represent the country at the Asian Games. Haryana’s Naveen Kumar Dagar went under the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 8:41.40 seconds as he crossed the finish line first with a time of 8:39.42 seconds. Dagar also broke his own meet record of 8:42.29 seconds set at the 2014 edition of the tournament. Shankar Lal Swamy of Rajasthan and Durga Bahadur of Uttar Pradesh took silver and bronze with times 8:43.52 seconds and 8:46.67 seconds respectively.

Another national record holder, Dutee Chand, shrugged off the disappointment of a defeat earlier in the competition to stamp her class on Thursday. Chand had been beaten to second place in the women’s 200m yesterday by home girl Hima Das, but marked herself out as the athlete to beat with a blistering time of 11.42 seconds in a heat of the women’s 100m sprint. The qualification guidelines for the event had stood at 11.67seconds.

High jumper Balasubramanya Chethan also managed to cross the qualification standard as he cleared a personal best of 2.25m in the men’s high jump competition. Chethan who made a massive 5cm improvement to his personal best, equalled the AFI’s qualifying guideline of 2.25m and also bettered the previous meet record of 2.23m set by Tejaswin Shankar at Guntur last year. Upcoming high jumper V Bharathi of Tamil Nadu cleared a creditable 2.21m to claim silver while Siddharth Yadav of Haryana clinched bronze with a jump of 2.19m.

Khyati Vakharia meanwhile endured a bittersweet moment on the podium in the women’s pole vault event. Although she managed to win gold and also equal her own meet record of 4.00m set in 2013, the 29-year-old from Karnataka fell short of the Asian Games qualifying standard of 4.10m. National record holder VS Surekha claimed silver with a best jump of 3.90m while Maria Jaison of Karnataka settled for bronze with a best effort of 3.70m.

The sixth and final meet record of the day would be set in the men’s 4x100m relay. The Tamil Nadu squad of S Rishwanth, Elakkiya Dasan, Manikanda Arumugam and Siva Kumar clocked 40.22 seconds to erase the old mark of 40.49 seconds set by the Kerala team in 2013.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Naveen-Sudha-Singh-Shipal-stars-of-Day-3-at-NISSAC2018.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/naveen-sudha-singh-shipal-stars-of-day-3-at-nissac2018/,Athletics
"Jinson Johnson creates history, breaks 42-year old Indian record","June 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 June 2018

Guwahati. Jinson  Johnson created history at the Indira Gandhi Stadium in Guwahati on Wednesday as he shattered the oldest standing record in Indian athletics. The 27-year old from Kerala clocked 1:45.65 seconds to win the gold medal in the men’s 800m event at the 58th National Inter State Championships. In doing so he erased the 42-year-old mark of 1:45.77 seconds set by Sriram Singh at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

It had taken a hard-fought race to push Johnson to the mark with the first four athletes in the race all managing to run inside the qualification guideline of 1:47.50 seconds set by the Athletic Federation of India for the Asian Games. Taking silver behind Johnson was Haryana’s Manjit Singh who clocked 1:46.24 seconds – a mark that was faster than the old meet record of 1:46.26 seconds set by Pankaj Dimri at the 2010 edition of the Inter State Championships. Claiming bronze was Mohammad Afsal of Manipur who clocked 1:46.79 seconds while coming in a credible fourth was Haryana’s Beant Singh who clocked a personal best of 1:46.92 seconds.

Also writing her name into the record books was Assam’s own Hima Das. The 18-year-old sprinter clocked 23.10 seconds to equal the meet record set by Rachita Mistry all the way back in 2000. Das also booked her spot for the Asian Games by finishing under the AFI guideline of 23.50 seconds. Pipped to second place was Orissa’s Dutee Chand who clocked 23.41 seconds. While Chand will be disappointed at having lost out to Das, she would be heartened by the fact that she had also qualified for the Asian Games owing to the fact that her timing matched the AFI’s guidelines. Coming in third place was Srabani Nanda who crossed the finish line in 23.87 seconds.

Despite falling short of the AFI’s guidelines, M Sreeshankar continued to impress. The 19-year-old from Kerala clinched gold in the men’s long jump, yet his best effort of 7.76m was five centimeters short of the AFI’s guidelines for the Asian Games. Sreeshankar who had battled past a case of appendicitis a few months ago, started off strongly, recording jumps of 7.76m in both his first and second efforts but was unable to improve on that mark.  Claiming second was Mehakpreet Singh of Punjab who was trailing in fourth place before he produced a jump of 7.63m in his final attempt. National record holder Ankit Sharma completed the podium with a best of 7.61m.

There would be brief excitement in the men’s pole vault competition too with two athletes setting meet records but neither would be able to come close to the AFI’s qualification guidelines for the Asian Games. Kundan Kumar of Haryana cleared 5.15m to erase the old meet record of 5.05m set by Ganjan Upadhyay  in 2007 while Siva Subrami of Tamil Nadu managed to equal that height. Anoop CB of Kerala took bronze with a clearance of 4.95m.

There would be disappointment for Muhammad Anas who was expected to come close to the National record in the men’s 200m race. Anas had come into the tournament having set a personal best of 20.76seconds a few weeks back and had appeared in good form in Tuesday’s heats setting a time of 20.95 seconds. However, he only managed to clock 20.97 seconds in what was still a gold medal winning performance.

25 June 2018

Guwahati. With spots in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games up for grabs, the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships, beginning June 26th in Guwahati, is expected to be a keenly contested affair.

While a few high profile names including Commonwealth gold medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and Commonwealth silver medalist discus thrower Seema Antil have been granted exemption from participation, the track section of the four day long competition should likely throw up some big results.  This will be largely due to the strict qualification guidelines — equivalent to top-4 or top-5 performance of the last Asian Games in almost all the events – and the fact that several athletes have been delivering strong performances in recent weeks.

Multiple Asian gold medalist PT Usha said the women’s 400m would in particular be an event to watch out for. “The competition in certain track events will be really strong here in Guwahati as athletes are well prepared. Since it is the final selection trial, athletes are determined to give their best. Hima Das has produced some really good results this year and I hope she will continue this for the rest of the season,” Usha said.

The 18-year-old Das is expected to be the highlight of what will be her home event. Das has improved dramatically in recent months. The Assam sprinter clocked a personal best of 23.22 seconds in the 200m in Poland earlier this month while she ran 51.32 seconds in 400m during the Gold Coast CWG. “”I have just returned from Poland where we went for month long training and I am feeling good. I am fully prepared for Inter State,” Das said.

Yet Das will face tough competition in both events. In 200m, she will compete against the likes of Dutee Chand and Srabani Nanda  while Asian championship gold medalist Nirmala Sheoran, who has a personal best of 51.28 seconds,  is expected to pose a serious threat. With veterans M R Poovamma and Jauna Murmu coming into form and teenager Jisna Mathew fresh off a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships, there are sure to be fireworks on the track.

Amongst the athletes to watch out for in the men’s section will be quartermiler Muhammad Anas. The 23-year-old who broke the national record during the Gold Coast CWG with an effort of 45.31 seconds, will also be competing in the 200m.

The results of the two 400m races will be particularly fascinating owing to the fact that the selectors would also be picking the team for the 4x400m mixed relay, to be held for the first time at the Asian Games this time. India has a decent chance to win a gold in this event.

In the long-distance section, plenty of eyes would be on 21-year-old Gavit Murli Kumar, who became the second fastest Indian in 10,000m with a 28:43.34 sec effort at the Gouden Spike Meet earlier this month, would want to show that his impressive display was no fluke. Murli, who is also competing in the 5000m race, though will not have it easy with double Asian gold medalist G Lakshmanan and T Gopi also in the fray.

An additional item of interest to the competition would be the return to the track of steeplechaser Lalita Babar. The 29-year-old former Asian Games bronze medalist had been out of action for over a year following her marriage but will be hoping to make up for lost time at the Indira Gandhi athletics stadium.

“We are expecting a very high level of competition this year in Inter State championships. The weather in Guwahati is perfect for athletes. I want to thank Honorable CM of Assam Shri Sarbananda Sonwal for providing such good facilities to all the teams and our National Campers here in Guwahati,” said CK Valson.",Dutee Chand,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/All-eyes-on-Hima-Anas-ahead-of-Inter-State-athletics.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/all-eyes-on-hima-anas-ahead-of-inter-state-athletics/,Athletics
Neeraj Chopra makes winning return at Indian Grand Prix,"February 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 February 2018

Patiala. Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra made a return to domestic competition with a strong performances to claim gold at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1. Chopra threw the spear a distance of 82.88m at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday to finish ahead of Vipin Kasana who managed a best throw of 80.04m. Amit Kumar took bronze with a best of 77.33m. It was a much anticipated result for Chopra, who was taking part in his first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

Chopra was not the only athlete to impress though. Shot Putter Tajinder Pal Toor claimed gold in the men’s shot put with a best throw of 19.95m. While Tajinder has a personal best of 20.40m, recorded at the same venue in June last year, his throw on Tuesday was credible coming as early as it did in the season. Toor, improved on 19.77m he threw to claim a silver at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January this year. Toor finished ahead of Naveen Chikkara who threw the put 19.08m while the bronze went to Paramjeet Singh who only managed 16.74m.

Two athletes would also join Chopra in meeting the AFI qualifying guidelines for the Commonwealth Games. Long jumper Nayana James and women’s discus thrower Navjeet Dhillon also managed to meet the minimum requirement.

James, carried on from the form that saw her winning silver at the Asian Indoor Championships by claiming gold in Patiala with a best jump of 6.47m. She finished ahead of Nina Pinto who cleared 6.41m. Purnima Hembram also managed to step on the podium with a best effort of 5.99m.

Former World Junior bronze medalist Navjeet Dhillon too delivered a personal best effort of 59.18m to inch past the AFI qualifying guidelines of 59m.

Also coming close to the qualifying guideline was triple jumper Rakesh Babu. The Kerala jumper managed a best of 16.59m on Tuesday coming a centimeter short of the AFI standard of 16.60m. Babu’s effort however was good enough to win gold, edging Commonwealth bronze medalist Arpinder Singh who managed a best of 16.45m. National record holder Renjith Maheshwary finished third with a jump of 16.09m.

Amongst the other bright performers of the day were MP Jabir who claimed the 400m hurdles gold with a time of 50.60seconds, just shy of his personal best of 50.22m. Jabir finished ahead of Santhosh Kumar (50.85 seconds) and Binu Jose (52.77seconds). Upcoming triple jumper Renu produced a mini upset on the day. Renu jump of 13.26m was enough to pip the 13.08m effort of NV Sheena, a silver medalist at last months Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran. 18-year-old Hima Das too gave a strong account of herself with a personal best timing of 11.74 seconds in the women’s 100m race. Das took silver behind gold medalist Dutee Chand who clocked 11.57 seconds.

G Lakshmanan and PU Chitra shines gold at AIMAG2017,"September 19, 2017","AFI Media

Ashgabat (Turkmenistan): Indian athletes continue their winning spree to win more medals on day-2 of athletics competition at 5th Asian Indoor & Martial Arts Games 2017 here in Ashgabat on Tuesday.

Lakshmanan was the star of the day, winning an expected gold in 3000m run with an 8:02.30 mins performance in the wake of his competitors producing their personal best performances. Tariq Ahamed Alamari (8.03.98 PB) of Kazakhstan and Hossein Keyhani (8.07.09 PB) of Iran had to settle for silver and bronze respectively despite their personal best shows.

“I never had any doubts that I will win the title. Tariq Ahmed (KSA) led most of the rounds but I accelerated in the final two rounds. That had always been my plan. I am very happy to add this gold medal to the Asian Championships 5000m and 10000m titles I recently won.

“My winning time was very close to my personal best over the distance.”, quoted the Asian Athletics Championships’ double medalist.

PU Chitra won the gold in women’s 1500m with a 4:27.77 performance closely followed by Gulshanoi Satarova of Kyrgyzstan (4.31.64) and Arina Kleshchukova (4.34.16).

“I ran a slower pace at the start and sped up in the final two rounds. I am so happy to have won my first 1500m indoor gold medal. Ashgabat 2017 was my first-ever indoor competition and it will always have a special place in my heart,” said Chitra.

“This was not my personal best time over the distance. I am not used to running under cold indoor conditions. It affected my rhythm. So, I decided I wanted the gold medal and not a new personal best time. I am satisfied,” she added.

Meanwhile, Amoj Jacob finished fifth (47.33) in men’s 400m while Dutee Chand missed out on the bronze in the women’s 60m sprint finishing fourth in 7.44s. In women’s triple jump too, Sheena N Varkey of India (12.96) missed out the bronze and finished fourth with 12.96m distance.

Anju Bobby George fan Obami Murmu and Dixsha claim NIDJAM Triathlon gold medals,"February 11, 2023","AFI Media

Patna, February 11: Dixsha (Jhajjar) and Obami Murmu (Paschim Midnapur) marked their debut on the national stage with gold medal victories in the girls U14 Triathlon A and B events respectively in the 18th National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet at the Patliputra Sports Complex here.

“Despite winning gold, I was disappointed that I did not do well in the 60m sprint. However, I am thrilled that I was able to speak to my idol Mrs. Anju Bobby George on the telephone before the medal ceremony today,” Obami Murmu, 13-year-old daughter of a trader, said.

Trailing Salem’s M Gopika and Tiruvannamalai’s R Bhavadharani after the sprint, she pitched in a good effort over 2.42m in the Standing Broad Jump. She then cleared 1.41m in the High Jump and heaved a sigh of relief when Bhavadharani’s High Jump campaign ended at 1.43m. Nadia’s Rinku Ghosh cleared 1.53m in the High Jump to edge past Gopika to the bronze medal.

Similarly, Dixsha’s 2.46m leap in the Standing Broad Jump earned her enough points to overcome the challenge of Anuskha Gutte (Bhandara) by a mere 32 points. Anushka Gutte secured more points than Dixsha in the 60m sprint and the Shot Put but missed out on gold as she mustered 2.10m in the Broad Jump.

The outcome of the Triathlon events reflected a couple of things. The scoring tables are different for boys and girls. Besides, U14 girls mature faster than the boys of their age. Himanshu Kumar Singh (East Singhbhum) rallied from a below par 60m sprint with splendid efforts in the Standing Broad Jump and High Jump to leapfrog past Dammu Ganesh (Visakhapatnam) to gold medal.

Kanak Devi (Saharanpur) rewrote the National record in the recently introduced Kids Javelin event when topping the girls U14 qualifiers for the final. She throw the Kids Javelin over 34.32m, past the existing mark of 33.60m set by Tejaswani Dhal in the National Junior Championships in Guwahati on November 14 last. Tejaswani Dhal was second with 31.65m today.

Meanwhile, Yashwant Reddy Kandu (Nalgonda) scorched the track when emerging the fastest of the Boys U16 80m sprinters who competed in a whopping 42 heats. His time of 9.26 seconds was 0.02 seconds faster than that of Varanasi’s Jamil Ali. As many as 20 athletes covered the distance inside 10 seconds

Avdesh Batham (Gwalior) clocked 4:31.71 to top the Boys U16 1600m qualifiers for the final. Fellow Manipur lads, Imphal East Sagolshem Rishan Meetei (4:33.18) and Bishnupur’s Nongthomba John Singh (4:33.84) produced a stirring heat that saw them finish with the second and third best times in 16 heats.

The crowd in the Patliputra Sports Complex rose on its feet when Pratigya Panna (Nilgiris), Muskan (Sonipat), Anshu (Aligarh) and Sonam Kumari (Ranchi) pushed one another hard when squaring up in a Girls U16 1600m heats. They produced four of the five fastest times in the seven heats, Pratigya Panna’s 5:20.15 being the best of the day.

With a 3.81m leap, P Shrihanish`a (Coimbatore) sailed into the final of the Girls U16 Long Jump, an event in which AFI restricted the length of the run up to 5m.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Press-Release.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/anju-bobby-george-fan-obami-murmu-and-dixsha-claim-nidjam-triathlon-gold-medals/,Athletics
Anju Bobby George expresses delight at being able to hold Woman of the Year Trophy,"December 3, 2021","AFI Media
New Delhi, December 3: World Athletics Woman of the Year Anju Bobby George today expressed delight at receiving her cherished trophy from World Athletics Council member and Athletics Federation of India President Adille J Sumariwalla at the Hotel Lalit here. “It is wonderful to be able to hold it,” she said.

The World Athletics Awards 2021 on Wednesday, when Anju Bobby George was declared winner of the Woman of the Year Award, was a virtual event. Mr. Sumariwalla, who attended the World Athletics Council meeting in Monaco, brought home the trophy to hand it over to Anju here. Indian Olympic Association President Dr Narinder Dhruv Batra was the Chief Guest at the ceremony.

Clasping the trophy, the 2003 World Athletics Championships Long Jump bronze medallist said the global honour made her more determined to promote gender equality in sport, especially in India.

“The award is not the culmination of a journey but a reminded that a lot more work needs to be done in the years ahead,” she said.
Mr. Sumariwalla said the enormous respect for Anju Bobby George in World Athletics circles was there for all to see.

“As her colleague in the Athletics Federation of India, I felt so much pride when the honour was bestowed upon Anju. She has already done tremendous work and will be inspired to contribute to the evolution of sport in our country,” he said.

It is well known that Anju Bobby George is actively involved in the sport. In 2016 she opened a training academy for young girls, where World U20 medallist Shaili Singh’s talent has been polished. The AFI Senior Vice President also mentors schoolgirls for future leadership positions within the sport.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Article-banner-ANJU.png,https://indianathletics.in/anju-bobby-george-expresses-delight-at-being-able-to-hold-woman-of-the-year-trophy/,Athletics
AFI AGM Release: It is the right time for me to take up leadership position in AFI: Anju Bobby George,"October 31, 2020","AFI Media

Gurgaon, October 31: Anju Bobby George, India’s only medallist in the World Athletics Championships, was elected as Senior Vice President of the Athletics Federation of India at its annual general meeting today, expressed delight at the increasing number of women in the Executive Council and said she is looking forward to serving the sport in her new capacity.

Besides the 2003 World Championship long jump bronze medal winner, former long-distance runner Suman Rawat Mehta (Vice President), former middle-distance runner C Latha (Joint Secretary) and A Hyma (Executive Council member) were the other women who were elected to the Executive Council for the four-year term.

Olympian Adille J. Sumariwalla was elected President for his third term while Ravinder Chaudhary and Madhukant Pathak were elected Secretary and Treasurer respectively. “We will continue making every effort for India to win an Olympic medal. With very good support from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, we have actively pursued this vision,” he said.

Anju Bobby George said it is the right time for her to take up a leadership position in AFI. “I have taken up other roles before this. Having served the country as an athlete and winning laurels for the country at the highest level, I believe I can connect well with all athletes and coaches to take India forward,” she said.

On the first day of the two-day annual general meeting, some key issues including age-fraud, doping and over-training were taken up. The house agreed that while AFI has taken many steps to curb age-fraud, State and district associations needed to be more proactive in ending the scourge of age-fraud that leaves athletes.

Mr. Sumariwalla, who said the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic had a cascading effect on a lot of areas in the sport, including the mental health of athletes and the earnings of the Federation, encouraged State Associations to actively seek the help of their respective State Governments to ensure that athletics competitions could resume sooner than later.

The AFI President made an impassioned plea to the State Association representatives to educate athletes on the evils of doping. “We hope the National Anti-Doping Agency will resume testing without any loss of time,” he said.

Dr Lalit K Bhanot, Chairman, Planning Committee, said it is important for all State units to be vigilant against coaches who encourage athletes to dope. He cited the example of an athlete who was banned by the Athletics Integrity Unit for a doping rule violation. “India would have lost two gold medals in the Asian Games if we fielded the athlete in the relay squads,” he said.

In response to claims by some non-members about the legality of Mr. Sumariwalla’s nomination for his third term, AFI clarified that he filed nomination not only as a President of Maharashtra Athletics Association but also as outgoing AFI President, as allowed by AFI Constitution (Clause XXVIII.A.e) which specifies the President need not require representation either to sit in meetings or even to contest election for the next tenure.

In keeping with its rich tradition, all positions in the AFI Executive Committee were elected unopposed.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Article-AFI-Banner.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-agm-release-it-is-the-right-time-for-me-to-take-up-leadership-position-in-afi-anju-bobby-george/,Athletics

Two of Indian track and field sports legends, World championship long jump medallist Anju Bobby George and Sriram Singh, who was seventh in the 800m in 1976 Olympic Games, were given the honour of being the first athletes to wear the simple and elegant team uniform unveiled by the Athletics Federation of India at its annual general meeting here today.

The uniform will easily distinguish the Indian athletes with its predominantly royal blue and stripes that incorporate saffron, white and green. Designed by AFI’s partner Shiv Naresh, the uniform is made of material that ensures the athlete’s highest level of comfort as it does not soak sweat and increase the load on the competitor.

The Federation took stock of India’s performances in the Asian Games in Jakarta last year and the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha earlier this year. While recording its happiness that the outcome was up to its expectation, AFI once again made a commitment to trying to help Indian athletes make their presence felt on the global stage.

“Government of India has acknowledged our efforts and AFI become the first National Sports Federation to get its Annual Calendar for Competition and Training approved till the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year. It has committed a lot of money, but we must ensure that we use it with responsibility, honesty and transparency,” AFI President AdilleSumariwalla said.

The Federation asked its members units from States and Union Territories to step up their activities to make track and field sport a more visible option for young athletes. “We want you to not only ensure that you stick to your respective annual calendars but also take up the responsibility of checking doping and age-fraud at the State level itself,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

“We want to make the State officials accountable for the growing menace of age-fraud. It is important that they conduct the recommended medical tests for age verification,” the AFI President said, indicating how it denied genuine athletes and raised false image of potential. The Federation asked the member units to show activity on ground and not on-paper.

AFI High Performance Director Volker Hermann briefed the members about his plans to help India improve its showing on the global stage. “Indian athletics is like a raw, uncut diamond of immense value but one that cannot be sold now. It is our duty to shape it,” he said, sharing timelines for the Olympic Games in Tokyo (2020), Paris (2024) and Los Angeles (2028).

Mr. Hermann emphasised the need to place greater stress on quality of training rather than quantity. He took long jumper M Sreeshankar as a case study and pointed out that for a teenager who leapt to 8.20m last year, he could be expected to be in the 8.40m and 8.60m range as his career-best – good enough to be in Olympic medal reckoning if that performance came at the right time.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AGM-AFI-Day-1-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/anju-bobby-george-sriram-singh-unveil-new-indian-athletics-team-uniform/,Athletics

AFI to decentralize national coaching camps from next calendar year,"September 29, 2023","AFI Media

New Delhi: To broaden the training base across the country, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has decided to decentralize national coaching camps from next calendar year, Adille Sumariwalla president of the AFI said on Thursday.

However, national camps in preparation for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games in select events will continue for the elite athletes.

Instead of having national coaching camps in three main cities—Bengaluru, Patiala and Thiruvananthapuram—the AFI in future will conduct as many as 20 camps across the country.

“The major decision to decentralize national camps was taken during AFI’s Special General Meeting held virtually on Thursday,” Sumariwalla added. “More pockets of coaching camps across the country will strengthen the infrastructure and broaden the training base.”

According to Sumariwalla, who is one of the vice presidents of the World Athletics, modalities to supervise the coaching camps across the country will be chalked out soon.

“The AFI will constitute a panel that will prepare a draft to oversee the functioning of the camps spread across the nation,” the AFI president said.

In preparation for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, the AFI will continue to have national camps for elite athletes in seven disciplines mainly javelin (men and women), steeplechase (men and women), jumps (long and triple), throws (men shot put), race walking (both men and women) and 4x400m relay (men and women). “We have a bright chance of podium in selected disciplines at the Olympic Games. Hence, we don’t want to break the rhythm of the core group of athletes in the above seven discipline,” he added

Generally, over 100 athletes are shortlisted for the national coaching camps in preparation for major competitions, including Asian Games. However, post decentralization the AFI president believes the number of the athletes selected for the camps will be over 400.

“For each training center the AFI might select around 50 athletes,” he added.

The virtual SGM meeting was attended by over 60 officials, including members of the state units. Former international athletes, including Olympian and world bronze medalist, Anju Bobby George, also attended the meeting.

According to Sumariwalla, majority of those present during the virtual meeting were of the view that national coaching camps should be conducted at several venues across the country.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-9.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-to-decentralize-national-coaching-camps-from-next-calendar-year/,Athletics

Shaili Singh’s 6.76m and Tajinderpal Singh Toor steal sprinter Amlan Borgohain’s thunder,"April 17, 2023","AFI Media 

Bengaluru, April 15: Uttar Pradesh teenager Shaili Singh leapt into the all-time second place behind her idol Anju Bobby George with a spectacular 6.76m effort in the women’s Long Jump in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics meet at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Saturday.

Later, Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor came up his career’s second best effort, 21.20m to share some of the limelight. Each of his five valid tries went past the 20m line, his best coming at the climax of the competition. It was only the third time that he was able to send the iron ball past the 21m mark after the 21.49m and 21.10m efforts in the span of a week in June 2021 in Patiala. 

Together with Shaili Singh’s brilliance, Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s exhibition of Shot Put under lights stole Amlan Borgohain’s thunder. The Assam sprinter claimed the men’s 100-200 double to hold the attention of the sparse crowd watching the events.

Shaili Singh, 19, improved her personal best by 28cm and catapulted over Aishwaya Babu (6.73), JJ Shobha and V Neena (6.66), Mayookha Johnu (6.64), M Prajusha, Nayana James and Ancy Sojan (6.55) to be behind Anju Bobby George (6.83m) on the all-time list. She qualified for the Asian Games, but fell an agonizing 9cm short of the 2023 World Championships qualifying standard.

Shaili Singh’s domination was so complete that each of her four valid jumps was good enough for het to get gold ahead of Nayana James’s best effort of 6.53m. Shaili Singh’s series read 6.58m, foul, 6.76m, 6.64m, foul and 6.66. It was a veritable demonstration of coach Bobby George’s assertion that his ward was ready to claim the National Record sooner than later.

Amlan Borgohain would not mind conceding the spotlight to her but the way he left the opposition in his wake in the 200m was creditable. The Assam sprinter now owns the three fastest times by Indians in the half-lapper. He set the National Record of 20.52 seconds in the AFI Federation Cup in Kozhikode on April 6 last year and the 20.55 he obtained in the National Games in Gandhinagar on October 4 last. 

Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh), the rising track star, lost out on a chance to attain a sprint double when she was disqualified for a foul start in the 100m. However, she overcome that shock and disappointment to win the 200m with a measure of comfort against Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu). Running a 200m after a year, she finished in a personal best time of 23.60 seconds. 

Trailing in the fifth place at the bell, Krishan Kumar (Haryana) caught up with race leader Abhishek Pal (Uttar Pradesh) with just 10m left to the beam and used his long strides to break the favourite’s will over the last couple of meters. Considering that it was only his first 1500m race at the national level after doing well in the 800m, Krishna Kumar was impressive in his victory. 

DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) produced a classy men’s Javelin Throw contest, slinging five throws over the 80m mark between them. Manu had the two best throws of the evening and won the crown with a best effort of 84.33m. Shivpal Singh (Uttar Pradesh) marked his returned to competition with a best effort of 79.70m on his second try.

Chirag Chaudhary leads the way in boys U16 600m on day 1 of NIDJAM 2023,"February 11, 2023","AFI Media

Patna, February 10: Mathura’s Chirag Chaudhary emerged the fastest qualifier for the boys U16 600m semifinal, clocking 1:24.59. Curiously, the three others to break the beam inside 1:25 – Akshay Dabre (Dehradun), Sayed Sabeer Sayed Suleman (Bangalore Urban) and Potharaboina Sandeep Kumar (Warangal Urban) – produced a fine finish after being drawn in the same heats.

For the U14, AFI introduces two sets of Triathlon events so that athletes could develop all-round skills. While 60m sprint and Standing Broad Jump were common to both groups, the athletes could choose between Shot Put and High Jump as their third choice. The two groups were called Triathlon A and Triathlon B respectively.

Thane’s Saif Farooq Chafekar claimed pride of place among the qualifiers for the boys U16 80m Hurdles semifinals with a time of 11.05 seconds. With five others finishing inside 12 seconds, the semifinals promise to produce some fireworks.

In the girls U16 80m hurdles, Mumbai Suburban’s Shaivi Rakesh Mehta and Satara’s Abhilasha Waghmare made the most of being drawn in the same heats and clocked the two fastest times with 13.18 seconds and 13.19 seconds respectively among the 40 entrants. East Godavari’s Pushyami Naga S Ganta was the only other competitor to dip in under 14 seconds.

Panipat’s Rudar topped the qualifiers for the boys U16 Discus Throw final with a best effort of 45.52m. Gautam Buddha Nagar’s Avinesh Talan (44.91m) and Gaya’s Priyanshu Sharma (44.61m) were the others who crossed the 44m mark. Salem’s Sanjay Kumar (43.24m) and Jaunpur’s Abhay Singh Patel (42.99) showed their potential to challenge the lead trio.

There was good news for Bihar when Siwan’s Alka Singh led the 16 qualifiers for the girls U16 Shot Put with a best effort of 12.32m.

AFI also conducted seminars on Anti-Doping, the adverse effect of over-training of young athletes and Safeguarding of Athletes from Harassment and Abuse in Sports (SAHAS).

Aishwarya’s leap puts Tajinderpal Toor and Annu Rani’s efforts in the shade,"June 12, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 12: Karnataka Long Jumper B Aishwarya’s explosive effort in the qualifying round put solid efforts by Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani in the shade on the third day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

Aishwarya produced a stunning 6.73m leap in the women’s Long Jump qualifying round for a new Meet Record. Other familiar names like Ancy Sojan and Nayana James (both Kerala) and World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) also made it. to the final without fuss.

The 24-year-old Aishwarya’s effort pitchforked her to the second place on the Indian all-time list behind Anju Bobby George who set the National Record at 6.83m in the Athens Olympics in 2004 and backed it with a 6.75m effort to win the World Athletics Final in 2005. She took over the meet record from Mayookha Johny, who had pegged it at 6.63m in 2011.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s search for 20m puts ended on Sunday evening when he was able to send the iron ball past that mark three times. Despite registering no marks on two visits to the circle, the 27-year-old Olympian came up with three efforts over 20.14m, 20.29m and 20.34m to fine form and run out an easy winner.

Uttar Pradesh’s Annu Rani, India’s only woman Javelin thrower in the 60m club, had only two legal throws on Sunday but the second of those was over 60.93m. She has thrown the spear farther twice this season, but she will be happy that she has regained the consistency that she had embraced in the rup up to the Olympic Games last year.

There was a shock in store for Andhra Pradesh’s 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, who made waves with a series of good races overseas during which she took ownership of the National Record with a 13.04-second effort in the Netherlands. She did not find the rhythm, knocking a couple of hurdles down and tumbling on to the track after crashing into the final hurdle.

Tamil Nadu’s C Kanimozhi won the event in 13.62 seconds, becoming the second fastest Indian in the event this year. Jyothi Yarraji has the top six times and Kanimozhi improved her season’s best from 14.07 seconds to rise to the second spot behind the National Record holder and above the likes of Nandini Agasara (Telangana) and Aparna Roy (Kerala).

Himachal Pradesh’s Ankesh Chaudhary (1:50.02), Haryana’s Krishan Kumar (1:51.19) and Kerala’s Mohammed Afsal (1:52.22) won their respective heats to make it to the men’s 800m final.

Neeraj Chopra launches Kids’ Javelin to build on the momentum of his Olympic Gold,"May 29, 2022","AFI Media

Chandigarh, May 29: Athletics Federation of India (AFI) on Sunday launched a Kids’ Javelin to sustain the momentum sparked by Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic Games gold medal in Tokyo. The Kids’ Javelin, designed and made by Vinex Sports, weighs just 300gm and will ensure safety of the athletes and everyone else around in the playfield. Neeraj Chopra himself launched the Kids’ Javelin through a video message from his overseas training location.

World Athletics Championships Long Jump silver medalist Anju Bobby George, AFI Senior Vice-President and 1962 Asian Games Decathlon gold medalist Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, AFI Selection Committee Chairman, were the first to receive the Kids’ Javelin from Vinex Sports Managing Director Ashuthosh Bhalla.

“We cannot let go of the spike in interest for athletics among youngsters in India. We had a Ball Throw event for Under-14 athletes, but we aim to replace that with the Kids’ Javelin Throw,” AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla told a media conference at the end of the two-day Annual General Assembly Meeting of the Federation at Hotel Shivalik here on Sunday.

“We have firmed up plans to widen the base of athletics even further and to provide better support to the athletes in both the development and elite stage. We are galvanizing the State and District Associations to draw more youngsters to our sport. For the best athletes in the country, we have got coaches from overseas to help their evolution,” he said.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot said the Federation was happy that athletes were showing improvement in many disciplines. “We are happy that we have three Triple Jumpers who have breached the 17m mark. We have grown in our traditional strength in the 400m and our young race walkers are showing promise,” he said.

In a major push towards digitalization across the board, AFI’s Units agreed to adopt an online entry system with an e-payment gateway for their respective State and Union Territory Championships. “Besides ensuring digital records of meets held around India, this move will help reduce the menage of age manipulation to a great extent,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

He said AFI reiterated its zero tolerance policy against doping in the AGM. “We are working with the National Anti-Doping Agency to try and keep our sport clean at all levels. We are educating our athletes, sharing intelligence with NADA about coaches and others suspected to be either carrying prohibited substances or encouraging younger athletes,” he said.

AFI also amended its Constitution in keeping with the Government’s request for compliance with the National Sports Code. It also resolved to enhance the popularity of its flagship National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet (NIDJAM). “We put systems and processes in place to ensure that track and field sport grows in the country,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neeraj-launches-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/neeraj-chopra-launches-kids-javelin-to-build-on-the-momentum-of-his-olympic-gold/,Athletics

“I remember Anju Bobby George asking us if there would be any competitions provided for the junior athletes, especially Shaili Singh.

And a year later, we will get all our 600-plus district units also to have similar competitions on August7,” said AFI Planning Committee Chairman Lalit K. Bhanot at function to felicitate him.

The 23-year-old Neeraj Chopra, India’s first Olympic medallist in track and field sport, said he was humbled by the announcement. “I am feeling good that the AFI is making my achievement to be remembered in the years to come. I will be happier if my gold medal win inspires youngsters to take to athletics, especially Javelin Throw,” he said.

“If the children are getting the Javelins and other facilities, I am sure they will come and take up the sport. I will be happy to cheer for them and they can be medal winners in the future, he told reporters at the media interaction that followed the wonderful felicitation ceremony at the well-appointed Taj Palace banquet hall.

He said the turning point in his career was his inclusion in the National Camp after he finished fifth in the National Games in Kerala in 2015. “Everything changed after my joining the National Camp – equipment, training facilities and diet. The feeling of training with the best javelin throwers in the country was special,” he said.

“I had already won the gold in Commonwealth Games and Asian Games and now the Olympic Games. So, my next target is the gold in the World Athletics Championships (in Oregon) next year. The World Championships is a big competition and sometimes tougher than the Olympic Games.

“I am not going to be content with this Olympic gold. I will want to win the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games titles again,” he said, pointing out that he was concerned about a few athletes testing positive for Covid-19 in the Games Village and that he was worried for himself.

AFI Senior Vice-President Anju Bobby George, the first Indian to win a World Athletics Championships medal when she picked up Long Jump bronze in 2003, said she was proud of Neeraj Chopra’s achievement that had ended a long wait for an athletics medal at the Olympic Games.

The AFI also felicitated Men’s 4x400m relay team that set a new Asian record at a time of 3:00.25, Kamalpreet Kaur who finished sixth in Women’s discus throw event with an effort of 63.70m and Avinash Sable who improved his own national record in the Men’s 3000m steeplechase event with a time of 8min 18.12sec at the Tokyo Olympic Games.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AFI-honors-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-decides-to-mark-august-7-every-year-as-national-javelin-day-to-honour-olympic-gold-medalist-neeraj-chopra/,Athletics

Sachin Tendulkar exhorts Indian athletes to pursue their dreams and victory,"July 20, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, July 20: Legendary Sachin Tendulkar exhorted the Indian athletics contingent heading to the Olympic Games in Tokyo to chase their dreams of winning medals for the country. “Pressure will be your constant companion, but you have raised the expectations with your performance,” he told the 26 athletes in a virtual send-off ceremony.

“You have worked hard in these difficult times. And if nobody has any expectations of you as an athlete, you are in the wrong place. You will have heard that winning and losing are part of sport. Let us win and let the others lose,” he said. “When you wear the medal, see the Tricolour go up and hear the National Anthem, it will be the biggest moment of your life.”

In an inspirational address, Sachin Tendulkar recalled that when he was recovering from a tennis elbow and a shoulder surgery in 2004-05, he realised during practice in England that international athletes sometimes forget the primary reason they set out to play sport. “It is a love for the game. I had to wake up the kid in me and bring him alive,” he said.

Indian Olympic Association President Dr. Narinder Dhruv Batra, who joined the ceremony from Tokyo, said he believed Indian athletics is on the cusp of winning that elusive Olympic medal. “I have seen the hard work by the Athletics Federation of India, and I know that athletics medal is not very far,” he said, encouraging the 47-member track and field squad.

After a welcome by Athletics Federation of India Senior Vice-President Anju Bobby George, AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla said the 26 athletes has earned the honour of representing the country on the biggest stage, but also had the responsibility to deliver their best performances and make India proud.

AFI Planning Commission Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot, who thanked the Government and the Sports Authority of India for the unstinted support before and through the pandemic, said he was hopeful that the best prepared Indian squad would be able to bring home medals from the Olympic Games this time.

Lord Sebastian Coe hails AFI for taking tough anti-doping stand,"November 1, 2020","AFI Media

Gurgaon, November 1: World Athletics President Lord Sebastian Coe today appreciated Athletics Federation of India for its tough stand against doping, for improving its athletes performances in a number of events and for being in the forefront of keeping the sport active in these uncertain times.

Addressing the valedictory session of the AFI annual general meeting today via video conferencing from London, Lord Coe said he was absolutely delighted to see the progress that India is making internationally in its performances in not just one or two events but across the broad spectrum.

“Also, the tough stand that you are taking in doing everything you can to eradicate the scourge of doping,” the World Athletics President said. “These are challenging issues in challenging times. I am delighted that you, like many member federations of World Athletics, are not hiding from these challenges.”

Lord Coe, who led a delegation of World Athletics to Tokyo recently, said he saw cast-iron determination to stage the Olympic Games next year. “There probably will be greater adaptation, they probably will demand more from your teams than we have seen at an Olympic Games before, but please reassure your athletes as they enter preparation stages that there is a determination to stage the Olympic Games in Tokyo,” he said.

He congratulated Olympians Adille J. Sumariwalla and Anju Bobby George for being elected unopposed as AFI President for the third successive term and Senior Vice President respectively. “It is my pleasure to welcome you back in your position, Adille,” he said, noting that the annual general meetings were important part of the calendar for any member federation.

Lord Coe said that despite huge uncertainties, World Athletics had done well in the traumatic months in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “World Athletics has made some brave decisions in facing many challenges,” he said, adding that such bravery would not count if member federations did not back them. “AFI has played an essential role in these times.”

On the concluding day of the annual general meeting, all State Associations made presentations with a sharp focus on growing transparency and accountability for the development of the sport in their respective areas. AFI also resolved to make every effort to ensure that some competitions could be resumed soon when learning to adapt to the current uncertainties.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AGM-final-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/lord-sebastian-coe-hails-afi-for-taking-tough-anti-doping-stand/,Athletics
Selfless Bahadur Singh gives credit for rise of Indian athletics to team-work,"July 11, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, July 11: True to his selfless nature, retiring National Chief Coach Bahadur Singh turned the attention away from himself at an emotional farewell function organised through a video conference. Saying the achievements of the Indian athletics fraternity over the past 25 years were due to collective efforts, he called for India to pay more attention to sports in schools.

“If India has risen to be a leading nation in Asian athletics, it is because of one man but because of team-work by athletes, coaches, the Athletics Federation of India, the Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports,” he said. “But if our schools let our children play sport and give them the facilities, India can be a world power.”

Bahadur Singh also pointed out that India sorely missed an indoor training facility. “We spend a lot of money in sending our athletes overseas when the climate at home does not permit training. India badly needs an indoor facility,” he said at an event that had more than 12000 views on Facebook and had a reach of more than 67,000

Saluting the 74-year-old athlete-turned-coach, Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Kiren Rijiju Mr. Rijiju recalled that he had been motivated by Bahadur Singh’s feat to be a shot putter himself in his school days. “Bahadur Singh has been an inspirational personality over five decades and rendered great service with his commitment, dedication and discipline,” he said. SAI Director General Sandip Pradhan also thanked Bahadur Singh for his contribution to Indian athletics.

Athletics legends Sriram Singh, PT Usha and Anju Bobby George shared their memories of Bahadur Singh. The 1976 Olympic Games 800m finalist, Sriram Singh recalled they had both started their Asian Games careers in Tehran in 1974 and completed the NIS coaching diploma in 1980. “Bahadur Singh had contributed immensely to the growth of Indian athletics,” he said.

Usha, fourth in the 1984 Olympic Games 400m hurdles, recalled that she was a teenager when she travelled with Bahadur Singh to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. “He was already a renowned athlete and inspired everyone with his hard work and dedication to training. As chief coach, he would motivate the coaches to do their best,” Usha said.

India’s first World Athletics Championships medalist, long jumper Anju Bobby George remembered her debut in the Commonwealth Games in 2002 when she was lying sixth with only one jump left. “We were trying to communicate in sign language but unable to understand one another, but he folded his hands in prayer and asked me to jump. I secured bronze,” she said.

M.R. Poovamma and Hima Das spoke for the current batch of athletes in national camp and said they would miss his genial personality by the trackside. “Bahadur sir has always encouraged us to rise to great heights and we recognise the sacrifices that he has made while making his priceless knowledge available to us,” Poovamma said.

Speaking for overseas coaches, Olympic medalist Galina Bukharina said Bahadur Singh treated every coach with respect. “He used his authority very differently, setting high targets and teaching everyone the value of success and results,” she said. Javelin throw coach Uwe Hohn said he respected Bahadur Singh for helping create the best possible conditions for athletes to train.

Bahadur Singh’s daughter Birpal Kaur, who logged in from Canada, and grand-daughter Dr. Jannat Sekhon,offered glimpses into a different facet of his personality. “My greatest memory of my father is his holding the National flag and wearing the legend ‘India’ on his back,” Birpal Kaur said, saying that while he had formally retired, she believed he would be at NIS before long,

Indian Olympic Association President Dr. Narinder Dhur Batra recalled watching Bahadur Singh be a self-reliant man despite being 73 years of age during the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018. He complimented the retiring Chief Coach for creating a great culture in the Indian athletics camps and for his achivements.IOA Secretary-General Rajiv Mehta said he would remember Bahadur Singh as always smiling and, with his simple approach, helping Indian athletics.

AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla, who welcomed the online gathering, said he would remember Bahadur Singh as the epitome of sportsmanship and for his will to fight to win. “He took over as Chief Coach when India got only three athletics medals in the 1994 Asian Games and steered the team to 20 medals in 2018,” he said.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot who was AFI Secretary-General when Bahadur Singh was made coach of the junior team in 1991 and of the senior team in 1994, spoke highly of Bahadur Singh’s unmatched vision and honesty. “He would always put others’ interest before his own and dedicated his entire life to athletics,” he said.

AFI Nominates Deserving Neeraj Chopra For Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award,"June 3, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, June 3: Athletics Federation of India has nominated Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medal winning javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. Having captured the attention of athletics fans around the world when he won the crown in the World Junior Athletics Championships in 2016, he has been India’s leading athlete since.

“We are sure that Neeraj will get the nod this time around after he missed out on being picked for the award when weightlifter Mirabai Chanu edged him out in 2018 and wrestler Bajrang Punia was chosen ahead of him last year,” AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla said. “The immensely popular athlete deserves the award for his performances ahead of the 2021 Olympics and it will motivate him to do even better.”

For the Arjuna Award, the AFI panel chaired by Anju Bobby George nominated 2018 Asian Games gold medallists, triple jumper Arpinder Singh and middle-distance specialist Manjit Singh as well as sprinter Dutee Chand, who won two Asian Games silver medals, and middle-distance runner PU Chitra who won gold medals in successive Asian Athletics Championships in 2017 and 2019 besides an Asian Games bronze.

“We believe that Awards selection committee will consider the fact that track and field sport is among the most intensely competed even in the continent. It is also important to remember that in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018, athletics accounted for 20 of 70 medals, including half of 16 gold, won by Indian sportspersons,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.

Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair, the only Indian to complete International Coaching Enrichment Certificate Programme by the International Olympic Committee with honors, has been nominated for the prestigious Dronacharya Award. “Radhakrishnan has selflessly hand-held many athletes and coaches over the past few years,” he said.

Kuldip Singh Bhullar, who won the discus throw silver medal in the 1982 Asian Games here, and sprinter Jincy Philip, who was part of the gold medal winning 4x400m relay team in the 2000 Asian Games in Busan, have been nominated for the Dhyan Chand Award, given for lifetime achievement to those who missed out on the Arjuna Award during their sports career.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Article.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-nominates-deserving-neeraj-chopra-for-rajiv-gandhi-khel-ratna-award/,Athletics
"Shaili, Vidhi rewrite meet records on opening day of MILO NIDJAM 2019","November 23, 2019","Tirupati, November 23: Long jumper Shaili Singh (Bengaluru Urban) and shot putter Vidhi (Meerut) broke meet records during qualification on the opening day of the 17th MILO National Inter-District Junior Athletics Meet 2019 at the Tarakarama Stadium in the Sri Venkateswara University Campus here on Saturday.

 

The 15-year-old Shaili Singh made light of the attention she got from that the goodly crowd, belying the pressure to nail down a place in the final with a leap of 5.93m on her first and only attempt. The National under-16 record holder gave evidence of her growing maturity in ignoring pressure and focusing on what she could do.

 

“I will do the best as I can,” she said as she waited for the other jumpers to finish their three jumps, She pointed out that the two years with coach Bobby George and World Championship medallist Anju Bobby George have made a vast difference to her approach. But pushed a bit to define how far she wanted to go, Shaili Singh spoke of having set the Olympic final as her goal.

 

Pariksha (Faridabad), Nivethitha Gnanaskand (Coimbatore) and Paveena Rajesh (Tirupur) finished within four centimeters of one another to raise expectations of a keen battle in the girls under-14 long jump final. Nivethitha Gnanaskand had finished on top of the heap in the National Junior Athletics Championship with 5.33m while Pariksha had finished second with 5.07m.

 

Vidhi (Meerut), who finished second in the National Junior Athletics Championships in Guntur earlier this month with a  throw of 14.40m, claimed the girls under-16 Shot Put meet record with  a throw of 13.80m. It was a 5cm improvement over the mark set by M Sharmila (Ramanathapuram) last year.

 

Two Mumbai throwers, Pristal Praveen D’Souza (Mumbai Suburban) and Arya Vasant Mandekar (Bombay City), were joined by  Rohtak’s Versha as the three girls under-14 shot putters who went past the 11m mark in qualification.

 

Vibhaskar Kumar (North West Delhi) led the boys under-16 100m semifinalists with a time of 11.34 seconds. Amirishetti Tharun (Karimnagar) and  Prince Chaudhary (Etah) were the other two boys who dipped in under 11.50 seconds, winning their heats in 11.42 and 11.44 seconds respectively. As many as 40 heats were run and the best 24 sprinters made it to the semifinals.

Reshma Gajanan Gore (Thane) breezed to victory in 12.58 seconds in her heats in the girls under-16 100m. Though four others broke the 13-second barrier, none of them could match her time. As many as 23 heats were run to spot the 24 fastest girls who would progress to the semifinals to be held on Sunday.

 

In the girls under-14 100m, Saanika Subhash Bangera (Udupi) was the fastest of the qualifiers in the first round, being the only one to break the 13-second barrier with a time of 12.98 seconds. Abhay Singh Kanwar (Bhopal) earned the honour of being the fastest qualifier in the boys under-14 first round with a time  of 11.61 seconds.

 

Avinash Prakash Patil (Kolhapur) clocked 52.68 seconds in the boys under-16 400m heats while I Shobhit (East Singhbum) was the other to slip in under 53 seconds on a day when as many as 30 heats were run.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image_day_1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/shaili-vidhi-rewrite-meet-records-on-opening-day-of-milo-nidjam-2019/,Athletics
Athlete Sreeshankar Murali can’t go so Romanian coach Bedros Bedrosian will come to him,"October 10, 2018","The AFI has also decided to rope in more coaches, including Bedros’s replacement, for the various national camps.

In the first such move of its kind, the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has decided to relocate a national camp coach to an athlete’s hometown in Kerala to facilitate training and ease the teenage long-jump prodigy’s concern about “college attendance”.

At a recent AFI meeting, it was decided that national jump coach Bedros Bedrosian, a Romanian, will move to Sreeshankar Murali’s hometown in Palakkad to focus on him and another long jumper Neena Varakil. Since the facilities in Palakkad are inadequate, the federation is in discussions to set up a facility for the youngsters.

“We decided during our committee meeting that Sreeshankar’s studies should not be affected. We see him as a potential medal winner at the Tokyo Olympics (2020) and decided to assign Bedrosian to him. He will be travelling to Sreeshankar’s hometown, and we are in talks for setting up facilities for them to train. This will ensure his studies don’t get affected and he trains regularly. We have done well at the Asian level but it’s not enough. We need to compete at the world level,” AFI president Adille Sumariwalla told The Indian Express.

The AFI has also decided to rope in more coaches, including Bedros’s replacement, for the various national camps. “We are in the process of signing up coaches from Cuba and New Zealand to enable our athletes to continue their evolution as top-class competitors. We are sure we will have them in place before the end of the first camp after the Asian Games,” Sumariwalla said.

Sreeshankar gave up an engineering course and opted for a B.Sc in Maths at Palakkad’s Victoria College to focus on jumps. “I am really glad that the federation is willing to set up a facility in Palakkad for us. I am happy that Bedros sir will be coming to monitor us but I will continue to train directly under my father,” Sreeshankar, 19, said.

Sreeshankar’s father Murali was an international triple jumper while mother K S Bijimol is an 800m Asian junior medallist. Murali says he is relieved that his son will not have to worry about “college attendance”.

“Education is really important. This move will ease his concern because they are very strict about attendance here. They don’t allow you to write your exams if you don’t have a certain percentage of attendance. He can now focus on training without worrying about college,” Murali said.

Sreeshankar has seen a lot of highs and lows this year. He missed the Commonwealth Games due to an appendix rupture that kept him in the ICU for three days. “I felt all my energy was sapped. I couldn’t even complete my warm-up rounds, let alone jumping. I lost a lot of strength in my legs but I had my father pushing and supporting

Long Jumper Can’t Miss College For Camp, So Coach Will Come Home me. I never lost hope,” he said.

Sreeshankar returned to the circuit with an Asian Juniors Athletics Championship bronze in June. He underlined his potential at the recent Nationals in Bhubaneswar, where he rewrote the national mark with a leap of 8.20m.

Although he is still some distance from being a world-beater, Sreeshankar has age and a calm mentality on his side. “He’s a fast learner. Last year, I suggested to his father a major technical tweak and you can see how quickly he has picked it up. He is a medal prospect, no doubt,” said Robert Bobby George, coach and husband of Anju Bobby George, the only Indian athlete to win a medal at the World Championships.

"Youngsters Neeraj, Hima and co. set to shine at the big stage","April 5, 2018","With India beginning its journey at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Thursday, three weightlifters are expected to deliver the first medals of the campaign. While Mirabai Chanu is expected to be dominant in the women’s 48kg category, keep an eye out for Muthupandi Raja in the men’s 62kg category as well.

At 18 years and five months, Raja is the youngest of the competitors in his division. Only just last year, he was competing in the boy’s category at the Commonwealth Championships where he won a gold.

However, Raja isn’t the youngest amongst his compatriots. That would be 69-kg competitor Deepak Lather, who is two months younger, and a bronze medallist competing in the senior category at the Commonwealth Championships.

Raja and Lather are just two of several Indian athletes in their teens — 28 in all — or barely out of it, who will be competing for medals in Gold Coast. They aren’t just there to make up the numbers either. Neeraj Chopra, 20, currently holds the best throw among javelin throwers from the Commonwealth participants this year and is India’s best bet in the field events, while quartermiler Hima Das (18) will be the driving force in the women’s 4x400m team. 19-year-old Divya Kakran too will be looking to add to her gold medal in the women’s 68kg wrestling competition.

The most precocious youngsters though, are to be found in the shooting squad.

Three members of the team — Manu Bhaker, Mehuli Ghosh and Anish Bhanwala are teenagers. All of them are favoured to win their respective events. Competing in the women’s 10m pistol event, 16-year-old Manu Bhaker is the youngest Indian competitor at Gold Coast and is coming off winning two gold medals at the ISSF World Cup in Mexico. Mehuli Ghosh, 17, won a bronze at the same tournament in the women’s 10m rifle. Bhanwala, 16, is fresh off a gold medal in the men’s 25m rapid fire pistol at the World Cup in Sydney. All three were competing in their first World Cup. “A new era in Indian shooting,” was how Abhinav Bindra described those performances.

Jaspal Rana, coach of the Indian junior shooting team — no stranger to early success himself (he won a World Championship gold when he was 18) — says young athletes have an inherent advantage. “You are fresh, new and have nothing to lose. You aren’t putting any pressure on yourself at this age,” he says.

That self belief has also been noticed by Olympian and the only Indian athlete to win a World Championships medal, Anju Bobby George. “Perhaps we were more hardworking, but the youngsters you see now are more bold,” she says. She remains astounded by the success of 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar, who after being introduced to the sport by a Physical Education teacher, picked up skills essentially over YouTube, much like javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra did. Shankar would go on to pack his bags and participate in collegiate athletics in the USA. “We would stick to doing only what our coaches told us. Our generation didn’t even know about such things like social media or how to use it to improve ourselves. Perhaps we wouldn’t even have thought of that,” she says.

India has had talented youngsters before. Most of them faded away, unable to carry their success into the seniors. Shooting had been a prime example of this with tales of unfulfilled promise to be found aplenty. Navnath Fartade won a junior world Championship gold in 2006 and subsequently a bronze at the Doha Asian Games, but is out of the national reckoning today.

The current generation though has it a lot smoother. Jaspal Rana believes the shift began about six years ago, when the national federation put in place a robust plan for supporting youngsters with the bulk (approximately 60 percent of funding) going towards them. “The funds are being given to the junior program. There is a proper system that’s been in place for the last six-seven years. Manu, Mehuli and Anish haven’t come up suddenly. There has been systematic training that has been responsible for their success.”

Despite the success that they have enjoyed recently, Rana says it’s best to remain cautious about their future. “We need to keep them grounded at this age. It is not fair to expect them to perform every time. You have to accept that they won’t get the results every time. In India, we have a habit of bringing them up very quickly and bringing them down very quickly.”

The youngsters themselves aren’t overthinking about the upcoming few days. “A part of me is excited that I will be competing against some of the best runners in the world,” says 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be part of the 4x400m relay squad. The team will face a tough task going against a Bahamas side that features Worlds silver medalist Steve Gardiner, a Botswana team that featured two finalists in the 400m at the World Championships and the defending relay world champion team from Trinidad and Tobago.

“There’s no point worrying about how I will perform against them. It’s a great opportunity. There’s nothing much to think about it. Thoda mauj aur phir fad do sabki (Have a little fun and then go all out),” he says.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/15-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/youngsters-neeraj-hima-and-co-set-to-shine-at-the-big-stage/,Athletics

"Devinder, Sonia win gold on opening day of Asian Games invitational tournament","February 11, 2018","Jakarta, Feb 11: India won two gold medals, three silver and as many bronzes on the opening day of athletics at the Asian Games invitational tournament in Jakarta on Sunday. While the purpose of the competition is to serve as a test event for the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Indian competitors put up a strong show ahead of what will be a busy season. Competing in his first competition of the season, javelin thrower Devinder Singh Kang, the bronze medalist at last year’s Asian Championships stamped Indian dominance in the event. Kang, a finalist at the 2017 World Championships, recorded a best effort of 75.87m to finish ahead of Ranasinghe Denagamage of Sri Lanka who had a best effort of 75.39m. 18-year-old Sachin Silwal added bronze for India with a best effort of 68.12m. Kang who recently began training under former world record holder Uwe Hohn, appeared out of touch initially and was trailing Denagamage until his final effort before producing a mark that put the gold medal out of reach of the Sri Lankan.

Sonia Baishya would add to India’s medal tally with a gold in the women’s 400m. Baishya, 22, would run the quarter mile in a time of 53.53seconds, to pip teammate Nithya Shree Ananda who clocked 54.34 seconds. It was a personal best for the West Bengal athlete beating her previous best by .45 seconds.
Jithu Baby added a silver to India’s kitty with a strong performance in the men’s 400m. Jithu, the reigning gold medalist at the Indian National Open Championships claimed gold with a time of 46.88 seconds to finish .05 seconds behind Pattiya Mullewaththe of Sri Lanka.

Another two medals were added by V Neena and Nayana James in the women’s long jump event. Neena, holder of the longest jump after Anju Bobby George, was nowhere near her best but still managed a leap of 6.42m. She finished ahead of compatriot James who cleared 6.16m in her final jump of the competition. The result mirrored the competition between the two at last month’s Asian Indoor Championships, where James, the reigning Asian Champion had claimed silver and Neena the bronze medal.

Competing in their first competition of the season, most Indian athletes appeared to be working their way into form. The exception though would be Elakiyadasan Kannadasan. The Tamil Nadu sprinter had the worst possible start, with the slowest reaction time (.152 seconds) and the disadvantage of running in the outermost lane. Despite this, Elakkiya Dasan clocked a credible personal best of 10.38 seconds to claim a bronze medal in the 100m in just his first outdoor competition of the season. Elakiyadasan has been in impressive start to the year. Running in the Asian Indoor championships in Tehran in January, Elakkiyadasan had claimed bronze. With the season only warming up, the 22-year-old would be expecting to push himself even further with hopes of qualifying for the Commonwealth Games.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/devinder-sonia-win-gold-on-opening-day-of-asian-games-invitational-tournament/,Athletics

"Meet OLLY- the turtle, Mascot of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships","May 7, 2017","May 07, 2017, Bhubaneswar: The Local Organising Committee of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships 2017 today unveiled the logo and mascot of the championships in a glittering ceremony held at the Kalinga Stadium Complex in Bhubaneshwar on Sunday, 07 May 2017.

Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik, unveiled the logo and mascot during the official announcement ceremony of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships 2017.
While logo depicts an athlete crossing the finishing line with historical tourist attractions of Odisha in the background, the mascot of the meet is an Olive Ridley Sea turtle named OLLY. Beaches of Odisha are a prime nesting site for these endangered sea turtles.

Speaking at the gathering, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha said, “I am delighted to be here today to announce that Bhubaneshwar will be hosting the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships. This will be the largest ever sporting event in Bhubaneshwar with participation of 45-countries. More than 700 athletes will participate in 42 athletics event spread over 4 days from 6-9 July, 2017 here at the Kalinga Stadium”.

“Bhubaneshwar has emerged as a sought-after destination for international competitions. The city is also going to host the Hockey World League Final in December 2017 and the prestigious Men’s Hockey World Cup in December 2018. I am sure, these athletics championships will provide substantial exposure to Odia boys and girls who will be watching World Champions in action.

“Kalinga Stadium is being transformed into a world class infrastructure facility for hosting international events as per requirements of International Association of Athletics Federation. All necessary steps are being taken to ensure a pleasant experience for the players, officials and visitors,”

In the 22nd edition of the biggest Athletics meet of Asia, around 700 athletes from 45 Asian countries will participate. The championships will also serve as a qualifying event for the IAAF World Championships 2017 to be held in London in August.

Lauding the efforts being put in by the Odisha Government to host the championships after Ranchi pulled-out few months back, Adille J. Sumariwalla, Athletics Federation of India (AFI), said, “Today, we are all gathered here to take that first step towards realising the idea we have all conceived together. To announce to the world, to announce to the Asian family and most importantly to the people of Odisha, that Kalinga Stadium would be the place where best of the Asian athletes will compete for a berth in the IAAF World Championships,

“When a month ago I came here with the proposal and Odisha said,” Okay, let’s do it.” I myself had doubts how we will be able to do it in such a short time. But today, on Sunday, 7th May 2017, having spent time with the team that is working day and night to make it possible, I can confidently say that the 22nd Asian Athletics Championship will be the best ever Asian athletics meet planned and delivered in such a short span of time”.

“Through these beautifully designed Logo & Mascot, the Championships has now got an identity. The logo and mascot will generate awareness amongst the masses and create a sense of belongingness to the Championships. While the Logo represents the beautiful state of Odisha and the passion to win in everything we do, the Mascot represents the endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtles whose biggest home is at the Gahirmatha Beach in Odisha. It is indeed a great idea that through this meet we will be contributing towards raising an awareness about preserving the habitat of these beautiful creatures who co-exist with us on this planet”.

Today’s ceremony was also attended by newly appointed Minister of Sports & Youth Services Department of Odisha Shri Chandra Sarathi Behra, former Olympians P.T. Usha and Anju Bobby George, C.K. Valson, Secretary AFI and other senior officials from the Government of Odisha.",Anju Bobby George,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/meet-olly-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/meet-olly-the-turtle-mascot-of-the-22nd-asian-athletics-championships/,Athletics
Spotlight on promising long jumper Shaili Singh,"March 19, 2024","Bengaluru:

Spotlight during the one-day third edition of the Indian Open Jumps Competition scheduled to be held Wednesday at Anju Bobby High Performance Center in Bengaluru will be on 20 years old Shaili Singh.

Being an Olympic year the world U20 silver medalist in women’s long jump has specific goals set this year. It is too early to expect outstanding performance nonetheless we are hoping for a good result, otherwise it will be a challenging task to earn a ticket to Diamond League competitions,” Shaili’s personal coach Robert Bobby George said on the eve of the outdoor domestic competition.

According to the national long jump coach, the first domestic competition in Bengaluru on Wednesday will be all about evaluation of performance and how to move forward in the right direction to win a ticket to the Paris Olympic Games. “We have set specific goals for each competition for Shaili Singh,” the long jump coach said.

Shaili has a personal best of 6.76m recorded last year in April in Bengaluru. While she finished fifth at the Hangzhou Asian Games with a jump of 6.48m.

The women’s long jump event in Bengaluru has attracted nine competitors including Nayana James of Kerala.

The focus will also be on men’s triple jump. Birmingham Commonwealth Games champion Eldhose Paul, Karthik U and Abdulla Aboobacker, all from Kerala, will commence their season with Bengaluru competition and will be looking ahead for a good performance.

Praveen Chithravel who holds the national record of 17.37m recorded last year will skip the competition. While promising Tamil Nadu triple jumper Selva Prabhu will compete in the U20 age group. His personal best and NR record of 16.78m was recorded last year.

Dhanalakshmi breaks Usha’s meet record and eyes sprint double in Federation Cup,"March 18, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 18: S Dhanalakshmi (Tamil Nadu), who stunned Dutee Chand in the 100m final on Tuesday, emerged as the sprinter to beat in the women’s 200m, clocking a Meet Record time of 23.26 seconds in the women’s 200m semifinals in the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports on Thursday.

Her victory over Hima Das (Assam) who clocked 24.39 seconds in the semifinal heats lifted her to the top 10 of Indian all-time list. Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) won her semifinal heats in 24.07 seconds to raise expectations of a good final. It must be stated that both Hima Das (23.10) and Archana Suseendran (23.18) have faster times than the one blazed by Dhanalakshmi on Thursday.

Her time broke PT Usha’s long-standing meet record of 23.30 seconds set in Chennai in 1998. Having run 24.05 seconds when finishing third in the Federation Cup here two years ago, she recorded a 23.47 in the Tamil Nadu State Championships in Sivakasi on January 24, thus making it the second time she was dipping in under 23.50 seconds.

Returning to competition after a long break, Swapna Barman won the Heptathlon with a total of 5636 points, her 1.82m High Jump making up for the 2:29.98 in the 800m. Mareena George (Kerala) finished second, a poor shot put performance denying her a shot at beating the 2018 Asian Games champion in the gruelling seven-event challenge.

The front-running Krishan Kumar (Haryana) beat back a stiff challenge over the last 100m by Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) in the men’s 800m. Those trailing Krishan Kumar at the bell may have been expected him to slow down but he chugged on. Ankesh Chaudhary stepped up the pace and even held the lead for a brief while on the home straight but he could not power on.

Delhi’s Chanda won the women’s 800m in a personal best time of 2 minutes 2.57 seconds. It was the fastest time clocked by an Indian woman since Tintu Luka’s 2:00.58 in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on August 17, 2016. It was a brave start-to-finish effort by Chanda, but she finished outside the Olympic Games qualification mark set at 1:59.50.

Lili Das (Bengal) moved up from sixth place with 150m left and timed her shift to the outside lane to a nicety to be able to slip past MR Poovamma (Karnataka) with only a few strides left for the finish. It was Lili Das’ personal best time, too, the 2:02.98 improving on the 2:03.46 that she clocked in Guntur in July 2017. Poovamma (2:03.35) also earned her personal best.

In fact, with Rachna (Haryana), Shalu Chaudhary (Delhi) and Aishwarya Mishra (Maharashtra) also clocking their best times, the women’s half-mile saw the top six runners attain new peaks respectively.

Talking of personal bests, Gracena Glistus Mery (Tamil Nadu) attained one with a 1.84m effort to win the women’s High Jump. The 20-year-old cleared that height on her second attempt after having needed three tries to cross the bar when it was placed at 1.81m. Her previous best of 1.79m was achieved in the University trials in Bhubaneshwar on March 8.

The last time an Indian woman jumped higher than Gracena Mery’s 1.84m was back on June 3, 2017 when heptathlete Swapna Barman cleared 1.87m. The girl from Kanyakumari thus becomes the latest Indian high jumper to join the 1.80m club. Her clearance drew gasps since it was the height that was good for bronze medal in the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018.

"AFI names Neeraj, Seema, PT Usha for sports awards","April 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 April 2018

New Delhi. Commonwealth Games gold medal winning javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has been recommended by the Athletics Federation of India for the country’s highest sporting honour – the Khel Ratna Award. In addition to the Khel Ratna, Chopra, 20, has also been recommended for the Arjuna Award by the federation. Chopra is one of three athletes who have been recommended for the Arjuna Award – with javelin thrower Annu Rani and four time Commonwealth Games medalist Seema Antil Punia also being recommended.

The federation has also nominated legendary athlete turned coach PT Usha for the Dronacharya Award.   India youth team coach, Sanjay Garnaik, has also been been recommended for the Dronacharya Award.

For Dhyanchand Award, the names of Boby Aloysis, Kuldeep Singh Bhullar and Jata Shankar have been recommended to the ministry by AFI while TP Ouseph is recommended for Life Time Achievement Award.

Neeraj Chopra-
The Commonwealth Games gold medal was only the latest of several accomplishments for Chopra in his short career so far. In 2016 he became the first Indian to win a gold medal at any world event in athletics when he claimed a gold at the World Youth Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland. His winning throw of 86.48m was both a national record as well as a still standing world record in the youth category. Chopra subsequently won a gold medal at the 2017 Asian Championships in Bhubaneswar. Favourite ahead of the Gold Coast games, Chopra would live up to that expectation. His throw of 86.47m would see him becoming only the fifth Indian athlete to have won a track and field gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.

Seema Punia Antil-
An Arjuna award for discus thrower Seema would be a suitable reward for a long career at the highest level. Seema was always destined for success, winning a medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships. Her excellent start at a junior level, however, hit the controversy immediately as she received a warning for the use of a stimulant- pseudoephedrine, a drug widely used in medications for common cold. Nevertheless, Seema has never been suspended and subsequently won a bronze at the 2002 World Junior Championships. The athlete competed nearly unstopped for the past two decades.  Starting with the 2006 edition in Melbourne, Seema has never finished out of the podium at the Commonwealth Games, winning a bronze and three silvers, the last of which came at the 2018 Games at Gold Coast. The 34-year-old athlete from Sonipat, Haryana, has also competed in 3 Olympic Games. In the last Asian Games at Incheon in 2014, Seema did India proud by winning a gold medal.
Bahadur Singh, Chairman of Arujna Award recommendation committee of AFI, said, “Seema deserves an Arjuna Award. She is one of the greatest and most consistent athlete India has produced. Her four-consecutive gold medals at Commonwealth Games proves that,”

PT Usha-
PT Usha’s Dronacharya Award nomination comes 34 years after she won both the Arjuna Award as well as the Padma Shri award for her achievement on the track – she had finished fourth at the 1984 Olympics. Usha who remains one of India’s most accomplished athletes with 11 medals at the Asian Games, had retired in 2000 with a promise to nurture a new crop of athletes. She has managed to do just that. The Usha school of athletics, formed in 2002 has consistently managed to produce athletes for the country. It’s most successful athlete has been 800m runner Tintu Luka. Luka has won two gold medals at the  Asian Championships and also a gold medal in the women’s 4x400m relay and a silver in the 800m at the 2014 Asian Games. Usha has continued producing athletes of excellence with Asian Junior champion Jisna Mathews the latest in the production line of excellence.
Annu Rani-
25-year-old Annu Rani is also in the running for an Arjuna Award. The national record holding javelin thrower, has won bronze medals at the 2014 Asian Games in Busan as well as the 2017 Asian championships in Bhubaneshwar. And although she missed making the Indian team at the Commonwealth Games, she would certainly be bidding to make up for it at the Asian Games in Jakarta.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/AFI-names-Neeraj-Seema-PT-Usha-for-sports-awards.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-names-neeraj-seema-pt-usha-for-sports-awards/,Athletics
"Tamil Nadu’s Asian medalist T Santosh Kumar won gold in 400m hurdles, but fell short of his goal","May 12, 2024","Bhubaneswar

Tamil Nadu’s International low hurdler, T Santosh Kumar clinched the first medal on the opening day of the 27th National Federation Senior Athletics Competition here at eight lane Kalinga Stadium on Sunday. His gold medal winning time was 50.04 seconds.

It was pleasant weather in the evening session due to overnight rain here, but the 25 years old Asian bronze medalist wasn’t able to achieve his desired goal during the medal round. “I had planned to break the 50 seconds barrier here in Bhubaneswar. But something went wrong somewhere,” he said in the mixed zone after winning the gold medal.

At the 2023 Asian Athletics Championships held in Bangkok, Santosh Kumar clocked 49.09 seconds to win bronze. The Tamil Nadu hurdler was, however, confident of breaking the 50 seconds barrier in coming weeks as it was important for him to improve his global ranking and qualify for the Paris Olympic Games starting from July 26 in France. “I will compete in Taiwan at the end of this month,” he revealed. “Hopefully I will be able to achieve my goal.”

Asian Games medalist Vithya Ramraj wasn’t able to add another gold to Tamil Nadu’s team as she stopped immediately after the start of the race. Later she claimed that she has back pain and is undergoing rehab. “I will come back strongly,” she said.

In her absence the gold went to Veerpal Kaur of Punjab. She clocked 59.43 seconds. The Punjab’s hurdler said she couldn’t have done better but there wasn’t anyone to challenge her in the race. “My goal was 58 seconds. But I missed it,” she added.

Away from low hurdles, it was start to finish for West Bengal’s Lilly Das on her debut in the women’s 5,000m race. She lapped the last runner and finished 250m ahead of the second runner. Her gold medal winning time was 16:31.05. Kerala’s Gokul KR was leading day-one of gruelling decathlon. He secured 3665 points at the end of the day. Delhi’s Neeraj Kumar was trailing at second place with 3442 points. While Tamil Nadu’s Stalin Joes was at third spot with 3407 points.

National and meet records continued to tumble on the second day of the 38th National Junior Athletics Championships here on Wednesday at the Nehru Stadium.

Haryana’s promising sprinter Bhawna broke a decade long girls U20 100m record today. Her gold medal winning time of 11.55 seconds was better than Dutee Chand’s national record of 11.63 clocked in 2013. The meet record was 11.76 seconds.

Throwers from Punjab continued to impress in the field events. Gurleen Kaur etched her name in the record books by improving the national and meet record in the girls U18 shot put.

It was celebration time for the Indian athletics contingent on Wednesday at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou as the overall medal tally swelled to 29, six of the gold. At the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games, the Indian athletics team had won as many as 20 medals, eight of them gold.

 

On the penultimate day of the track and field, as expected Olympic and world champion, Neeraj Chopra was successful in defending javelin crown, while men’s 4x400m relay squad wrote a glorious chapter by winning gold.

 

The men’s javelin competition witnessed technical glitch, but it didn’t spoil defending champion tempo. The event became more exciting as Kishore Kumar Jena took the lead after the third round with a throw of 86.77m.

 

But Chopra’s experience paid off as he hurled javelin to a distance of 88.88m in his fourth attempt to take the pole position. Chopra eventually won the gold, while Jena’s best throw of the day was 87.54m, a personal best fetched him silver. Jena also bettered the Paris Olympic Games qualification mark of 85.50m.

 

The quartet of Muhammed Anas, Amoj Jacob, Muhammed Ajmal and Rajesh Ramesh were also successful in winning gold in the men’s 4x400m relay. The Indian team won silver at the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games.

 

The women’s 4x400m relay team, however, had to settle for silver.

 

Distance runner Avinash Sable (5,000m) and Harmilan Bains (women’s 800m) won silver on Wednesday in their respective events.

Indian team win four medals on Monday at the Asian Games,"October 2, 2023","AFI Media

New Delhi

It was another eventful day at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou on Monday as Indian athletes won three silver and one bronze medal to swell the tally to 16, two of them gold.

India’s 28 years old Asian champion, Parul Chaudhary, set the tone for the day by winning silver in women’s 3000m steeplechase. While Priti claimed bronze behind Parul.

Long jumper Ancy Sojan and the 4x400m mixed relay team added two more silver medals to the tally.

After a slow start Ancy gradually moved up the ladder to claim silver in long jump, it was a disappointing day for promising long jumper Shaili Singh as she finished fifth.

Tejaswin Shankar was leading Day-One in decathlon (100m, long jump, shot put, high jump and 400m). He collected 4260 points.

“I have a healthy lead. Will go back to the village and recover to prepare for the second day as the decathlon is all about ten events,” Shankar said.

In the women’s pole vault, Pavithra Vengatesh finished sixth. She cleared 4m.

Earlier, the morning session was quite productive. Both Sarvesh Anil Kushare and Jesse Sandesh advanced to the final round of the men’s high. In the qualification both Kushare and Sanesh cleared 2.10m to finish in ninth place. Top 12 or 2.26m was the automatic qualification mark.

Krishan Kumar (1:49. 45 secs) and Muhammed Afzal (1:46.76 secs) also qualified for the men’s 800m final.

It was smooth sailing for both Santhosh Kumar (49.28 secs) and Yashas P (49.61 secs) into the medal round of the men’s 400m hurdles.

The most exciting event of the day turned out to be the women’s 400m hurdles heat. India’s Vithya Ramaraj clocked 55.42 seconds, a personal best, to equal the long standing national record of PT Usha set at 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.

Sinchal Kaveram, the second Indian in the women’s low hurdles clocked 58.62 secs in heat and failed to progress to the final.

Prachi will compete in the women’s 4x400m relay, while Borgohain will compete in the men’s 200m. His season best was 20.55 seconds.

The AFI selection panel has dropped injured Akshdeep Singh and replaced by Vikash Singh in the men’s 20km race walk.

Bal Kishan missed the chance to make the cut for the Asian Games as he trailed at seventh place in the men’s steeplechase. He clocked 8:55.96 secs.

The men and women’s 4x100m relay teams were not selected for the Asian Games.

The men’s team clocked 39.24 seconds and the women’s squad time was 45.66 seconds.

“The Indian Grand Prix leg in Chandigarh was a good chance for me to prove my fitness. I’m excited to have earned a ticket to China,” Priti said.

Hangzhou Asian Games bound Tamil Nadu’s 24 years old R Vithya Ramraj too hogged the limelight as she narrowly missed the national women’s 400m hurdles record of 55.42 seconds clocked by legendary PT Usha at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.

Running in lane number five Vithya ran a race of her life to clock 55.43 seconds in the 400m hurdles on the final day of the fifth leg of the Indian Grand Prix on Monday. “I just missed that long standing record by a fraction. I’m not upset but more confident of breaking that long standing record in my next race,” Vithya said in the post-race interaction.

On Sunday, the opening day of the IGP, she dominated the women’s 400m clocking 52.40 seconds.

Vithya was confident of a podium at the Hangzhou Asian Games starting September 23 in China. “The competition in China will be more challenging. It will certainly give me a chance to further improve my performance,” she added.

At Bhubaneswar’s national inter state athletics championships held in June, Vithya won the 400m hurdles with a time of 56.01 secs. “I was a bit tired during the race as I was competing in two races in Bhubaneswar. But I knew I could do better in future,” Vithya recalls.

Shaili Singh’s 6.76m and Tajinderpal Singh Toor steal sprinter Amlan Borgohain’s thunder,"April 17, 2023","AFI Media 

Bengaluru, April 15: Uttar Pradesh teenager Shaili Singh leapt into the all-time second place behind her idol Anju Bobby George with a spectacular 6.76m effort in the women’s Long Jump in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics meet at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Saturday.

Later, Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor came up his career’s second best effort, 21.20m to share some of the limelight. Each of his five valid tries went past the 20m line, his best coming at the climax of the competition. It was only the third time that he was able to send the iron ball past the 21m mark after the 21.49m and 21.10m efforts in the span of a week in June 2021 in Patiala. 

Together with Shaili Singh’s brilliance, Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s exhibition of Shot Put under lights stole Amlan Borgohain’s thunder. The Assam sprinter claimed the men’s 100-200 double to hold the attention of the sparse crowd watching the events.

Shaili Singh, 19, improved her personal best by 28cm and catapulted over Aishwaya Babu (6.73), JJ Shobha and V Neena (6.66), Mayookha Johnu (6.64), M Prajusha, Nayana James and Ancy Sojan (6.55) to be behind Anju Bobby George (6.83m) on the all-time list. She qualified for the Asian Games, but fell an agonizing 9cm short of the 2023 World Championships qualifying standard.

Shaili Singh’s domination was so complete that each of her four valid jumps was good enough for het to get gold ahead of Nayana James’s best effort of 6.53m. Shaili Singh’s series read 6.58m, foul, 6.76m, 6.64m, foul and 6.66. It was a veritable demonstration of coach Bobby George’s assertion that his ward was ready to claim the National Record sooner than later.

Amlan Borgohain would not mind conceding the spotlight to her but the way he left the opposition in his wake in the 200m was creditable. The Assam sprinter now owns the three fastest times by Indians in the half-lapper. He set the National Record of 20.52 seconds in the AFI Federation Cup in Kozhikode on April 6 last year and the 20.55 he obtained in the National Games in Gandhinagar on October 4 last. 

Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh), the rising track star, lost out on a chance to attain a sprint double when she was disqualified for a foul start in the 100m. However, she overcome that shock and disappointment to win the 200m with a measure of comfort against Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu). Running a 200m after a year, she finished in a personal best time of 23.60 seconds. 

Trailing in the fifth place at the bell, Krishan Kumar (Haryana) caught up with race leader Abhishek Pal (Uttar Pradesh) with just 10m left to the beam and used his long strides to break the favourite’s will over the last couple of meters. Considering that it was only his first 1500m race at the national level after doing well in the 800m, Krishna Kumar was impressive in his victory. 

DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) produced a classy men’s Javelin Throw contest, slinging five throws over the 80m mark between them. Manu had the two best throws of the evening and won the crown with a best effort of 84.33m. Shivpal Singh (Uttar Pradesh) marked his returned to competition with a best effort of 79.70m on his second try.

"Amlan, Sreeshankar and Jyothi mark domestic season debut with facile victories","April 10, 2023","AFI Media

Bengaluru, April 10: Sprinter Amlan Borgohain (Assam), Long Jumper M Sreeshankar (Kerala) and 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh) made their first appearance in a domestic competition this year memorable by winning gold in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 3 Athletics competition at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today.

Amlan Borgohain, 24, claimed the 100-200 double. Having taken a break after the Asian Indoor Championships in February, he returned to outdoor competition and sustained his acceleration to clock 10.50 seconds and win by two-hundredths of a second from Amiya Kumar Mallick (Odisha). He returned to the track less than an hour later to take the 200m in 21.20 seconds.

Commonwealth Games silver medalist Sreeshankar, whose last competition was the National Games in October 2022, produced three efforts that were good for gold today. The World No. 6 won with a leap of 7.94m on his last try. He was satisfied with his efforts since he is coming back from a grade 2 hamstring injury that kept him on the sidelines for three months.

Like Amlan Borgohain, Jyothi Yarraji took a break from competing after the Asian Indoor Championships and marked her return in the same venue where she rewrote the National Record at 12.82 seconds. She cruised to a win, clocking an easy 13.44 seconds, suggesting that India’s only sub-13 second hurdler was focusing on getting the technique right at the start of a big season.

Aishwarya Kailash Mishra (Maharashtra) became the third Indian woman 400m sprinter to clock a sub-54 seconds time twice this year. She won the event today in 53.63 seconds, leaving Kiran Pahal (Haryana) in her wake. Muhammed Ajmal won the men’s quarter-mile in 46.63 seconds, his best effort of the year and the third time he has gone below 47 seconds in 2023.

Hima Das, who had to endure a disqualification for a false start in the Indian Grand Prix 2 in Thiruvananthapuram, bounced back to win the women’s 200m while GK Vijayakumari (Karnataka) returned to a national-level 800m after five years and beat Madhya Pradesh’s KM Deeksha with a surge over the last 100m.

Jeswin Aldrin ends long wait to own men’s Long Jump National Record with 8.42m leap,"March 4, 2023","AFI Media

Bannihatti (Ballari), March 1:  Jeswin Aldrin (Tamil Nadu) captured the spotlight with a new National Record of 8.42m in men’s Long Jump in the second AFI National Jumps Competition at the Inspire Institute of Sports in Vidyanagar near here this evening. He broke the 8.36m mark set by M Sreeshankar in the Federation Cup in Kozhikode in April last year.

His massive jump put the men’s Triple Jump contest in shade, though Praveen Chithravel (Tamil Nadu) tried hard to make the most of the familiar Mondo runway here and found a meet record with a 17.17m effort. Praveen Chithravel went past the 17m mark three times this evening but the National Record of 17.30m remained elusive.

High Jumper Savesh Anil Kushare (Maharashtra) also took ownership of the meet record with a successful clearance of 2.24m.

Jeswin Aldrin, the 21-year-old who won the Asian Indoor Championships silver medal with a 7.97m effort last month, made the most of being in competitive shape to earn the National Record. That distinction eluded him in Kozhikode where he won gold with a leap of 8.37m but since it was a wind-aided effort, he could not make the record his. 

A measure of his dominance can be had from the fact he was the only competitor to pass the 8m mark this evening. He opened with 8.05m and followed it up with 8.26 before finding the combination of speed and power to get to 8.42m. He could afford to pass the next three jumps, leaving Muhammed Anees Yahiya (Kerala) in a distant second place at 7.85m

“The National record has been a while coming and I am happy it has come at a venue where I have been training. It is the result of the hard work turned in here over the last few years,” he said, having qualified for this year’s World Athletics Championships, Asian Games and next year’s Olympic Games. “I now want to produce this kind of performance in the global level.”

Earlier, Gayathry Sivakumar set a new women’s Triple Jump meet record with a hop, step and jump over 12.98m to break the 12.68m mark set by Aleena Jose in the inaugural edition in Thiruvananthapuram last year. She had only two valid jumps in six attempts, but both were good for gold. She opened with a 12.46 and got the record in her third attempt.

Tamil Nadu’s R Punitha, who edged out an error prone Sharvari Parulekar (Maharashtra) in the contest for the women’s Triple Jump silver medal, saw the tables being turned in the evening when Manisha Merel (Odisha) came up with a last-ditch 5.96m effort. Punitha had two jumps of 5.85m but strained a muscle and had to pass the last two attempts.

Tanya Chaudhary and Mansi Negi shift focus on U20 athletes with National marks,"November 13, 2022","Guwahati, November 13: Tanya Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) and Mansi Negi (Uttarakhand) forced the attention to be shifted to the under-20 athletes with National Record performances in the women’s Hammer Throw and 10000m Race Walk in the 37th AFI National Junior Athletics Championships in the Athletics Stadium at the SAI Regional Centre here today.

On the first two days, athletes from the younger age groups were the ones who broke National records.

Tanya Chaudhary improved her own U20 National records from 57.04, set in Nadiad earlier this year to 58.30m today.

In the women’s U20 10000m Race Walk, Mansi Negi clocked 47 minutes 30.94 seconds to take ownership of the U20 National and Meet records. Munita Prajapati had pegged both records at 47:53.58 at the Sarusajai Stadium here last year.

"Puneet Yadav makes memorable 10,000m debut with U23 meet record","October 29, 2022","Bilaspur, Oct 29: Puneet Yadav, a strapping 19-year-old from Haryana, caught the eye with a smart victory as he led a bunch of eight men who finished the 10,000m with 15 seconds of one another in the second AFI National Open U23 Athletics Championships at the BR Yadav Stadium in Behetrai here today.

Running his maiden 25-lap race at the national level, Puneet Yadav did well to stay in the lead group, ensuring that he would be in the best position to sprint to victory. He won in a time of 29:44.64, nearly a minute faster than Kartik Kumar’s winning time (30:41.66) in the inaugural championships in New Delhi last year.

Delhi’s Rohit Kumar, who was sixth in a pacy race in the recent National Games, took bronze behind Farookh Choudhary (Uttar Pradesh). Sumit Goliyan had originally finished third but was disqualified for being over-age.

The men’s Triple Jump final saw a thrilling finish. Tamil Nadu’s S Robinson claimed the lead with a personal best effort of 15.56m only to watch his team-mate J Mohanraj produce a 15.65m hop, step and jump for his personal best legal effort. Kerala’s Akash Varghese stunned them both by regaining his lead with a 15.70m try that will go down as his personal best.

Mallala Anusha (Andhra Pradesh) won the women’s Triple Jump on a countback after Karnataka’s Pavithra tied her best effort with a 12.79m try. Anusha’s second best effort was 12.78m while Pavithra could not go past the 12.73m mark as her second best effort. Haryana’s Mimansa Dahiya took bronze with 12.75m.

Yogita Kumar, fourth last year, produced a personal best effort of 14.90m to claim the women’s Shot Put gold today. Four of the Haryana athlete’s puts, beginning with her opening try of 14.50m, were good for her to win the crown with her best coming on her third visit to the circle. Last year’s bronze medalist V Ambika (Karnataka) took silver this time.

Jyothi Yarraji stands tall as first Indian woman Hurdler to break 13-second barrier,"October 17, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 17: Jyothi Yarraji (Railways) made history by becoming the first Indian woman to clock a legal sub-13 second time for 100m Hurdles at the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today.

The 23-year-old cruised to victory in 12.82 seconds and, with the wind gauge reading 0.9m/s, she could not be denied that honour a second time. She had won the National Games in IIT Gandhinagar in a time of 12.79 seconds but was supported by wind that exceeded the permissible limit.

Jyothi Yarraji was unstoppable tonight. She had already owned the meet mark with 13.18 seconds in the heats, bettering the record of 13.38 seconds set by Anuradha Biswal in Chennai 20 years ago. In the final, she hit the front by the time the seven athletes got to the second hurdle and was a comfortable winner.

The Railways star, who hails from Andhra Pradesh and trains in Bhubaneswar, capped a fine season, with a fumble only at the National Inter-State Championships in Chennai in June. She thus became the second fastest Asian in the event this year and earned a place just outside the continent’s all-time Top 10 list.

It was the third time this year that she rewrote the National record. She broke Anuradha Biswal mark of 13.38 set in 2002 with 13.11 in Loughborough University on May 22. Four days later, she raised the bar to 13.04 seconds in Vught, Netherlands. Earlier, had a 13.09-second effort in the Federation Cup in Kozhikode but was denied by excessive wind speed.

Late on Sunday evening, Parshant Singh Kanhiya (Railways) claimed the men’s Pole Vault meet record when he cleared 5.15m. S Siva, who broke his own National record in the recent National Games, cleared 5.00m to concede a handsome victory for Parshant Singh Kanhiya.

Aishwarya’s leap puts Tajinderpal Toor and Annu Rani’s efforts in the shade,"June 12, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 12: Karnataka Long Jumper B Aishwarya’s explosive effort in the qualifying round put solid efforts by Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani in the shade on the third day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

Aishwarya produced a stunning 6.73m leap in the women’s Long Jump qualifying round for a new Meet Record. Other familiar names like Ancy Sojan and Nayana James (both Kerala) and World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) also made it. to the final without fuss.

The 24-year-old Aishwarya’s effort pitchforked her to the second place on the Indian all-time list behind Anju Bobby George who set the National Record at 6.83m in the Athens Olympics in 2004 and backed it with a 6.75m effort to win the World Athletics Final in 2005. She took over the meet record from Mayookha Johny, who had pegged it at 6.63m in 2011.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s search for 20m puts ended on Sunday evening when he was able to send the iron ball past that mark three times. Despite registering no marks on two visits to the circle, the 27-year-old Olympian came up with three efforts over 20.14m, 20.29m and 20.34m to fine form and run out an easy winner.

Uttar Pradesh’s Annu Rani, India’s only woman Javelin thrower in the 60m club, had only two legal throws on Sunday but the second of those was over 60.93m. She has thrown the spear farther twice this season, but she will be happy that she has regained the consistency that she had embraced in the rup up to the Olympic Games last year.

There was a shock in store for Andhra Pradesh’s 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, who made waves with a series of good races overseas during which she took ownership of the National Record with a 13.04-second effort in the Netherlands. She did not find the rhythm, knocking a couple of hurdles down and tumbling on to the track after crashing into the final hurdle.

Tamil Nadu’s C Kanimozhi won the event in 13.62 seconds, becoming the second fastest Indian in the event this year. Jyothi Yarraji has the top six times and Kanimozhi improved her season’s best from 14.07 seconds to rise to the second spot behind the National Record holder and above the likes of Nandini Agasara (Telangana) and Aparna Roy (Kerala).

Himachal Pradesh’s Ankesh Chaudhary (1:50.02), Haryana’s Krishan Kumar (1:51.19) and Kerala’s Mohammed Afsal (1:52.22) won their respective heats to make it to the men’s 800m final.

Yashvir’s dramatic entry to 80m Club steals Women Long Jumpers’ Thunder,"May 24, 2022","AFI Media

Bhubaneswar, May 24: It needed something special to take the focus away from the long jump pit in the Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics Competition at the Kalinga Stadium here on Tuesday night. And two young Javelin Throwers, Yashvir Singh (Rajasthan) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) delivered that performance by going past the 80m mark.

On a night when Nayana James produced two efforts over 6.37m to win the high-profile women’s Long Jump title from Ancy Sojan (6.35m) and World U20 Silver Medalist Shaili Singh (6.27m), Yashvir Singh wrested the spotlight with a winning effort of 82.13m. The 20-year-old thus became only the 12th Indian to send the spear over 80m.

The Rajasthan thrower became the third javelin thrower from the country after DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) to join the 80m Club this year. Yashvir Singh, who missed the mark by a whisker in Patiala on March 17 last year, got his ahead of Rohit Yadav and Manu on Tuesday night to win gold.

The men’s Long Jump did not have as much drama as the women’s event since each of Muhammed Anees Yahiya’s four legal jumps on Tuesday night was good enough to fetch him gold. The Kerala jumper peaked with his two of his last three tries, crossing the 8.00m mark. The 8.15m effort on his fifth attempt was the best of the night.

From the home fans’ point of view, Amiya Kumar Mallick and Aryan Ekka’s 1-2 in the men’s 100m sprint as well as Srabani Nanda’s victory in the women’s 100m were pleasing. The two Odisha men drew from one another in the second of the four races. Srabani Nanda, running her first 100m in around a year, had to find her own pace to win in

Warangal, September 17: Parul Chaudhary (Railways) completed a golden double by beating back a game challenge by Maharashtra’s Komal Chandrakant Jagdale in the women’s 3000m Steeplechase final in the 60th National Open Athletics Championships at the Jawaharlal Nerhu Stadium in Hanamkonda here on Thursday.

Though Ram Baboo (Uttar Pradesh) was credited with the only National Record-breaking performance when he won the men’s 35km Race Walk in 2 hours 46 minutes and 31 seconds, it was the women’s 3000m Steeplechase made for great viewing for the goodly crowd that turned up. Both Parul Chaudhary and Komal Jagdale ended up with personal best times.

To be sure, the Tamil Nadu Mixed 4x400m Relay squad came up with a new Meet Record in an enthralling final which saw fancied Railways being disqualified after Kiran Pahal, running the third leg, stepped inside the kerb when jostling for space on the inside with Delhi’s Pooja. The credit for Tamil Nadu’s victory should go to R Vithya Ramaraj’s spectacular third leg when she lifted her team from fifth place to second for P Abhimanyu to come up with a memorable anchor leg that saw him overhaul a 5m lead held by All India Police at the start of the final leg.

Aware that she had to outrun the established Steepelchaser, Komal Jagdale sought to open up a big lead in the early part of the race. Parul Chaudhary made the most of that pace to script her best time in the event, lowering her personal best by a whopping 10 seconds. It was the first time she dipped home inside 10 minutes.

While Parul Chaudhary relied on her better finishing skills to slip past Komal Jadgale on the final lap after tailing her through the race, the Maharashtra runner made a last-gasp attempt to surprise her rival on the home stretch but the Railways ace sensed it and lunged in the nick of time to win by two-hundredths of a second.

Railways’ B Aishwarya claimed the women’s Long Jump crown with an opening leap of 6.52m that propelled her among the top jumpers in the country. For someone whose previous best effort was over 6.25m on January 3, 2020 and the best this season was 6.16m in the Railways trials, the 24-year old will have pleasantly surprised fans of athletics.

"Tajinderpal Singh Toor and Annu Rani rewrite meet marks, showcase consistency","June 28, 2021","Patiala, June 28: Shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani (Uttar Pradesh) showed their preparations for next month’s Tokyo Olympic Games were on track with new meet records on the penultimate day of the Fast&Up 60th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Monday.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor, who achieved Olympic qualification with a new National Record of 21.49m here last week, showed a praiseworthy consistency with each of his five legal puts over the 20m mark. Despite securing the meet mark with 20.63m on his second try and being assured of victory with 20.96m on his fourth visit to the circle, he uncorked a final put of 21.10m

Annu Rani, who had trained her sights on the Olympic Qualifying mark of 64.00m, opened with a throw of 62.83m to improve her own meet mark by nearly three meters. Assured of victory, she when her subsequent throws did not travel the distance she would have liked, the World No. 13 stepped over the line each time to register no more legal throws.

It was the 10th time in her last 11 competitions, dating back to August 30, 2019, that she went past 60m mark. More importantly, she would be pleased with the fact that she has won each of the five competitions at home this year with such throws. She is ranked 14 in this year’s top list and is confident of making her presence felt in Tokyo2020.

Sri Lanka’s Kalinga Kumarage and Karnataka’s Priya Habbanathahally respectively won the men and women’s quarter-mile events. Kalinga Kumarage found the pace to clock a personal best time of 45.73 seconds, improving on the 45.99 he clocked in the Jakarta Asian Games nearly three years ago.

With National Record holder M Sreeshankar (Kerala) not competing on Monday, his team-mate Muhammed Anees Yahiya claimed the men’s Long Jump title with a best effort of 7.76m on his last try. Yugant Shekhar Singh (Uttar Pradesh), who had a best of 7.63 on his third attempt, went all-out to wrest the lead but ended up with three no marks.

There would great interest in the final day’s schedule when discus thrower Seema Punia will try to breach the Olympic qualifying mark of 63.50m. Besides, the men’s 4x400m relay squad would attempt to match, if not better, the 3:01.89 clocked on Friday to confirm their place for the Tokyo Olympics 2021.

"Avinash Sable, Neeraj Chopra and Tajinderpal Toor give India reason for cheer","March 17, 2021","AFI Media

Patiala, March 17: Avinash Sable (Maharashtra) paid the best possible tribute to the late coach Nikolai Snesarev posting a new National Record time of 8 minutes 20.20 seconds as he won the men’s 3000m Steeplechase on the third day of the 24th National Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here on Wednesday.

Along with javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and shot putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor, Sable gave India much reason for cheer. Neeraj Chopra broke his own meet record while Tajinderpal Toor had a superb series of throws.

Sable, who set the earlier National mark at 8:21.37 in the World Championships in Doha on October 4, 2019, broke free of the pack after a lap and a half and raced the clock. Having already secured Olympic qualification, the 26-year-old was a picture of determination and confidence as he chased his target time – almost as if to honour the late Belarussian coach.

Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra sustained his fine run of form with a massive throw over 87.80m on his final attempt which secured him a new meet record. Having raised the National record to 88.07m in the Indian Grand Prix III here on March 5, he showed a hunger for consistency and desire to embrace consistency rather than rest on his oars.

Earlier, 26-year-old Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) uncorked a series of big throws as he sought to meet the Olympic qualifying mark of 21.10m. Opening with a throw of 19.99m, the strapping left-hander went past the 20m mark on each of his four other legal throws, recording 20.20, 20.17, 20.58 and 20.47 with a foul on his fourth try.

The World No. 24 was looking to join 24 others who have achieved the Olympic entry standard. At the moment, he is third on the list of eight who can qualify on the basis of their world ranking. The final two attempts on Wednesday evening showed that he is getting better outcomes for his sustained efforts.

Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) played the waiting to game to perfection, letting Komal Jagdale (Maharashtra) set the pace but staying on her heels through the women’s 3000m Steeplechase only to sprint away in the final 200m to a secure comfortable win in the end. She was also superior at the water jumps where Komal Jagdale lost some precious time.

Priyanka Kerketta (Jharkhand) came up with a final effort of 6.10m to leapfrog to gold medal past Rintu Mathew (Kerala) and Sherin Abdul Gafoor (Tamil Nadu), who both had best efforts of 6.07m each. Priyanka Kerketta, 22, was lying in the fourth spot with a best of 6.01m but her final jump pushed Telangana’s Agasara Nandini out of the medal bracket.

Ankesh Chaudhary (Himachal Pradesh) won the fastest of three men’s 800m semifinals, clocking 1:50.81 ahead of Krishan Kumar (Haryana) and Anu Kumar (Uttarakhand) but the with Asian Games gold medalist Manjit Singh (Haryana) in the fray, the final could see a faster time.

The women’s two-lap final will pit MR Poovamma against Delhi’s Chanda and Shalu Chaudhary as well as Lili Das (West Bengal) and Haryana’s Rachna.

On Tuesday, a few days shy of his 19th birthday, Usaid Khan (Uttar Pradesh) won the tough Decathlon with 6890 points. He built a total of 3572 points on the first day with good performances in the 100m and 400m sprints to insure against the strong second day challenge of Navjor Singh (Punjab). By improving his throwing, Usaid Khan can aspire to rise as an Asian Games prospect.

AFI condoles sudden passing of coach Nikolai Snesarev,"March 5, 2021","AFI Media

New Delhi, March 5: Athletics Federation of India today condoled the sudden demise of noted distance running coach Nikolai Snesarev in the Netaji Subhash National Institute of Sports in Patiala. The 72-year-old Belarussian national died with his boots on, having overseen his wards’ training this morning.

AFI President Adille J Sumariwalla led the outpouring of grief in the athletics community. “We are stunned by the news that coach Nikolai was found dead in his room today. He returned to India only a few days ago, having agreed to train steeplechaser Avinash Sable for the Olympic Games in Tokyo,” he said. “We will cherish his long association with Indian athletics and will miss him.”

Mr. Sumariwalla said India was fortunate to have benefit from Nikolai Snesarev’s rich experience over a number of years. “He was a hard-taskmaster and one who developed his own training routines for his athletes. He was highly respected in the international circles and we were privileged that he shared a wonderful relationship with India,” he said.

Having first come to India in 2005, Nikolai Snesarev coached 10,000m runners Preeja Sreedharan and Kavita Raut to a 1-2 finish in the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou and Steeplechaser Sudha Singh to gold. It was the first time that Indian women won medals in the 25-lap race.

Later that year, he suggested to Lalita Babar to shift to Steeplechase. And, thanks to his sustained efforts, she became the first Indian athlete to reach a track final in the Olympic Games since PT Usha in 1984 when she made it to the Steeplechase final in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. He trained a number of Indian distance runners to attain peak performance.

“As someone who believed in research, he showed us the way with his pioneering efforts towards improving the endurance and speed of his athletes. He insisted that athletes never touch any medicines while training with him, imposing a blanket ban on all kinds of medication, even prescribed ones,” Mr. Sumariwalla said.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dr-nikolai.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-condoles-sudden-passing-of-coach-nikolai-snesarev/,Athletics
"Parasappa Hajilol, Sonika claim cross country titles on challenging course","February 21, 2021","Chandigarh, February 21: Parasappa Madevappa Hajilol (Karnataka) and Sonika (Haryana) won the men and women’s 10km races in the SBI 55th National Cross Country Championships on a picturesque but challenging course in the ATF Golf Meadows in Dera Bassi near here. The course, with 2km grassy loops, was designed with undulations and included some slushy sections as well.

The 25-year-old Parasappa Hajilol, who hails from Bijapur and trained in Dharwad, surprised not only the more seasoned Vikram Bangriya (Madhya Pradesh) and Maharashtra steeplechaser Adesh Yadav but also a host of experienced runners like Abhishek Pal (Railways) and AB Belliappa, Darshan Singh, Hari Singh and defending champion Anish Thapa Magar (Services).

The fog that hung over the vast sylvan expanse that made the venue added a charm and to the degree of difficulty in the men’s race in which 224 runners were at the start. But Parasappa Hajilol’s time of 31 minutes 13.21 seconds was less than a minute slower than Anish Thapa Magar’s 30:31.00 in the previous edition in Warangal in January 2020.

The fog lifted by the time 173 women lined up for the start of their race. Sonika, a 21-year-old from Rohtak, and Maharashtra runners Komal Jagdale and Nikita Raut stunned defending champion Kavita Yadav and last year’s runner-up Varsha Devi (Railways) into fourth and fifth places respectively.

Despite losing its hold over the individual prizes, defending champion Services held back Railways’ challenge to retain its grip on the men’s team title, with each of its top four runners finishing in the top 10. Abhishek Pal was the only Railways runner with a top 10 finish on Sunday but with the others in the top 20, it was able to drive Madhya Pradesh into the third place.

The women’s team event saw a remarkable upset with Haryana unseating Railways from the top spot. With Sonika, Sanju, Munni Devi and Bharti each securing a top-10 finish, the Haryana quartet pipped Railways to the crown. Interestingly, the Railway team – Kavita Devi, Varsha Devi, Nandini Gupta and Priti Lamba – also had top-10 finishes but Haryana enjoyed a 2-point lead.

The 18-year-old Ankita claimed the first new mark after national-level competition resumed after the Milo National Inter-District Junior Athletics Championships in Tirupati in November 2019, the Khelo India Youth Games in Guwahati in January 2020 and the Khelo India University Games in Bhubaneshwar in February 2020.

The girl from Uttarakhand ran the 5000m race at her own pace to finish in 16:37.90 to claim top honours in the Federation Cup Junior Athletics Championships for the second successive time. She lowered Suman Rani’s record of 17:02.67 set in Coimbatore in 2018. Ankita had won the 5000m race in Tiruvannamalai in September 2019 with a time of 17:16.49,

Ankita went on to add the 1500m title, doing just enough to stay ahead of Haryana’s Pooja and winning with a time of 4:27.54.

Sunil Dawar, a South Asian Games 5000m silver medallist in 2019, claimed the 1500m meet mark by clocking 3:48.54 to improve on the 3:51.16 set by Shashi Bhushan Singh in Hyderabad in 2015. With Sree Kiran finishing nearly 10 seconds later, Sunil Dawar would have been left wishing for stiffer competition and a crack at Ajay Kumar Saroj’s National mark of 3:44.96 set in 2016.

Saurabh Rajesh Naitam (Maharashtra) and Taranjeet Kaur (Delhi) emerged the fastest athletes of the meet, winning the men and women’s 100m sprints respectively in 10.51 seconds and 11.70 seconds.

Selfless Bahadur Singh gives credit for rise of Indian athletics to team-work,"July 11, 2020","AFI Media

New Delhi, July 11: True to his selfless nature, retiring National Chief Coach Bahadur Singh turned the attention away from himself at an emotional farewell function organised through a video conference. Saying the achievements of the Indian athletics fraternity over the past 25 years were due to collective efforts, he called for India to pay more attention to sports in schools.

“If India has risen to be a leading nation in Asian athletics, it is because of one man but because of team-work by athletes, coaches, the Athletics Federation of India, the Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports,” he said. “But if our schools let our children play sport and give them the facilities, India can be a world power.”

Bahadur Singh also pointed out that India sorely missed an indoor training facility. “We spend a lot of money in sending our athletes overseas when the climate at home does not permit training. India badly needs an indoor facility,” he said at an event that had more than 12000 views on Facebook and had a reach of more than 67,000

Saluting the 74-year-old athlete-turned-coach, Union Minister of State for Sports and Youth Affairs Kiren Rijiju Mr. Rijiju recalled that he had been motivated by Bahadur Singh’s feat to be a shot putter himself in his school days. “Bahadur Singh has been an inspirational personality over five decades and rendered great service with his commitment, dedication and discipline,” he said. SAI Director General Sandip Pradhan also thanked Bahadur Singh for his contribution to Indian athletics.

Athletics legends Sriram Singh, PT Usha and Anju Bobby George shared their memories of Bahadur Singh. The 1976 Olympic Games 800m finalist, Sriram Singh recalled they had both started their Asian Games careers in Tehran in 1974 and completed the NIS coaching diploma in 1980. “Bahadur Singh had contributed immensely to the growth of Indian athletics,” he said.

Usha, fourth in the 1984 Olympic Games 400m hurdles, recalled that she was a teenager when she travelled with Bahadur Singh to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. “He was already a renowned athlete and inspired everyone with his hard work and dedication to training. As chief coach, he would motivate the coaches to do their best,” Usha said.

India’s first World Athletics Championships medalist, long jumper Anju Bobby George remembered her debut in the Commonwealth Games in 2002 when she was lying sixth with only one jump left. “We were trying to communicate in sign language but unable to understand one another, but he folded his hands in prayer and asked me to jump. I secured bronze,” she said.

M.R. Poovamma and Hima Das spoke for the current batch of athletes in national camp and said they would miss his genial personality by the trackside. “Bahadur sir has always encouraged us to rise to great heights and we recognise the sacrifices that he has made while making his priceless knowledge available to us,” Poovamma said.

Speaking for overseas coaches, Olympic medalist Galina Bukharina said Bahadur Singh treated every coach with respect. “He used his authority very differently, setting high targets and teaching everyone the value of success and results,” she said. Javelin throw coach Uwe Hohn said he respected Bahadur Singh for helping create the best possible conditions for athletes to train.

Bahadur Singh’s daughter Birpal Kaur, who logged in from Canada, and grand-daughter Dr. Jannat Sekhon,offered glimpses into a different facet of his personality. “My greatest memory of my father is his holding the National flag and wearing the legend ‘India’ on his back,” Birpal Kaur said, saying that while he had formally retired, she believed he would be at NIS before long,

Indian Olympic Association President Dr. Narinder Dhur Batra recalled watching Bahadur Singh be a self-reliant man despite being 73 years of age during the Asian Games in Jakarta in 2018. He complimented the retiring Chief Coach for creating a great culture in the Indian athletics camps and for his achivements.IOA Secretary-General Rajiv Mehta said he would remember Bahadur Singh as always smiling and, with his simple approach, helping Indian athletics.

AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla, who welcomed the online gathering, said he would remember Bahadur Singh as the epitome of sportsmanship and for his will to fight to win. “He took over as Chief Coach when India got only three athletics medals in the 1994 Asian Games and steered the team to 20 medals in 2018,” he said.

AFI Planning Committee Chairman Dr. Lalit K. Bhanot who was AFI Secretary-General when Bahadur Singh was made coach of the junior team in 1991 and of the senior team in 1994, spoke highly of Bahadur Singh’s unmatched vision and honesty. “He would always put others’ interest before his own and dedicated his entire life to athletics,” he said.

Saturday was no different as Bahadur Singh chose to train the spotlight away from himself on to larger cause of India sport.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bhagadur-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/selfless-bahadur-singh-gives-credit-for-rise-of-indian-athletics-to-team-work/,Athletics

Anjali Devi’s 51.53-second sprint sets Track a blaze,"August 29, 2019","AFI Media

 

Lucknow, August 29: Haryana’s Anjali Devi marked her return to competitive racing from rehabilitation from injury with a stunning victory in the women’s 400m in the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Thursday. She clocked a personal best 51.53 seconds, beating SaritabenGayakwad (Gujarat) and Jisna Mathew (Kerala) by a distance.

 

Anjali Devi, who had qualified for the IAAF World Championships as early as in September last year with a 51.79-second showing in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneshwar, showed that a long absence from track did not affect her quest for a quick time. She dipped in under the World Championships qualifying standard on Thursday as well.

 

Considering that no other Indian 400m runner has achieved the qualifying standard of 51.80 seconds, 20-year-old Anjali Devi’s feat on Thursday caught the attention of track and field fans in India. She had been part of the squad that had Spala as its training base but returned home to get her ankle attended to after she was unable to clock impressive times at home in March this year.

 

“Having not run since the Federation Cup (in March), I knew I would have to give my best in the final,” Anjali Devi said. “I am grateful to all those who stood by me when I was getting my ankle treated. The national coaches have been in touch with me and I have trained under coach RohtasSiwach at home before coming here.”

 

Marathon specialist Gopi Thonakal (Kerala) won the grueling 10,000m in 30:52.75, outsprinting Arjun Kumar (Uttar Pradesh) and Vikram Bangriya (Goa). Easily the oldest of the 25 men who took the starter’s orders, Gopi’s victory is creditable when viewed against the fact that as many as 13 runners, including Maharashtra’s Murli Kumar Gavit and KisanTadvi dropped out.

 

With L Suriya opting not to run the women’s 10,000m race and with 5000m winner Parul Chaudhary (Uttar Pradesh) not entering the event, Phoolan Pal ensured that the distance gold medals would remain with the home State. Phoolan Pal and Karnataka’s Kavita Yadav were engaged in a gritty duel but the Uttar Pradesh runner turned in a good kick in the end.

There was a keen battle at the high jump pit with SarveshKushare (Maharashtra), Geo Jose (Kerala) and B Chethan (Karnataka) finishing within 4cm of one another. For the 24-year-old SarveshKushare, who won the National Open last year at 2.24m, he had to achieve his year’s best height to win gold on Thursday.

 

Chethan sought to lay the gauntlet down by entering the competition only when the bar was raised to 2.10m but when it was set at 2.16, he encountered two failures and though he cleared 2.19m on first attempt, he found 2.21m hard to go over. That left the hard working Geo Jose, who joined the fray at 1.95m, a comfortable winner of the silver medal.

 

World University Games champion Dutee Chand’s presence on the track aroused excitement during the 100m semifinals. She clocked 11.34 seconds and will need to be faster in the final to breach the 11.24-seconds mark that will grant her automatic qualification for the World Championships in Doha next month. Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu) won the other semifinal heats in 11.49.

In the men’s 100m semifinals, 19-year-old Nuzrat of Haryana scripted the fastest time of 10.51 seconds. Kiran Bhosale (Maharashtra) was second in that heats in 10.57 and the two of them dragged Vinit Panwar (Manipur) and Rohith (Karnataka) as well into the final as the two fastest runners from among those who did not place first or second in their heats.

 

The results (finals):

Men:

10000m: 1. Gopi Thonakal (Kerala) 30:52.75; 2. Arjun Kumar (Uttar Pradesh) 30:55.71; 3. Vikram Bangriya (Goa) 30:59.98

"Manjit Singh, Lili Das stars at final-leg of IGP in Chandigarh","March 6, 2019","AFI Media

06/03/2019

Chandigarh. Timings and throws improved for Indian athletes competing at the Indian Grand Prix-4 held at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Panchkula on Wednesday. That performances have gone up can be seen from the fact that four Indian athletes – in the men’s and women’s 1500m race – managed to clear AFI qualification guidelines for Asian Athletics Championships that will be held in Doha, from the 21st to the 24th of April. However, the final selection of Indian team for Doha championships will take place after 23rd Federation Cup Senior National Athletics Championships to be held from 15-18 March 2019 in Patiala.

Haryana athlete Manjit Singh Chahal, who had won a gold medal in the 800m at the Asian Games, grabbed the gold medal with a superb run in the men’s 1500m race. He crossed the finish line in a time of 3.45.37, going under the qualification guideline which stood at 3.46.00. He was joined by Ajay Kumar Saroj, who clocked a time of 3.45.75, also under the qualification guideline. Saroj, 22, will be hoping to defend his Asian Championships gold medal, having won the 1500m race at the previous edition in Bhubaneswar in 2017. Uttar Pradesh athlete Rahul didn’t make the cut, but would be satisfied with his bronze medal which he won by clocking a time of 3.48.63.

In the women’s competition over the same distance, Lili Das and PU Chithra went under the AFI’s guideline of 4.15.00. The 21-year-old Das, representing West Bengal clocked a time of 4.13.53 to edge out Kerala’s Chithra who clocked a time of 4.13.58. Chithra won the gold medal of the 1500m race at the 2017 edition of the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar. Haryana’s Usha Sharma was well off the pace, coming in third with a time of 5.03.00.

Despite their strong performances, the best athletes of the day award went to VK Vismaya of Kerala and Arokia Rajiv of Tamil Nadu who won the women’s and men’s 200m race. Arokiya Rajiv who won two silver medals over the 4×400 men’s and mixed team relay at the Asian Games last year, was fast off the blocks in the 200m race, and won with a time of 20.74, not far from the national record of 20.63 which stands in the name of Muhammad Anas. Rajiv was hardly challenged in his race, with national record holder Anas clocking 21.15 to take silver while Punjab’s Lovepreet Singh claiming bronze with a time of 21.59.

In the women’s race, VK Vismaya, who’s better known for winning a relay gold in the women’s 400m at the Asian Games won over the shorter distance with a new personal best time. Vismaya clocked 23.80 to shave .10 off her previous best of 23.90. She easily beat Karnataka’s NS Inchara who stopped the clock at 24.05 while Anjali Devi climbed the third step of the podium with a time of 24.35.

While athletics drew much of the attention, there were some good performances in the field events too. The highlight of the day came in the women’s javelin throw where Sharmila Kumari recorded a personal best throw to sound a warning early in the season. Kumari, who won a gold at the National Open athletics Championships last year, recorded a throw of 56.36m with her first attempt of the competition. The only other competitor, Prabhdeep Kaur of Punjab, wasn’t even close, recording a best effort of 38.12. Kumari is not far from the AFI guideline of 58m and will hope to touch that mark at the Federation Cup that will begin on March 15.

Youth Olympic athlete Tai Bamhane claimed the gold medal in the girls 1500m race, finishing with a time of 4:38.28. The Nashik based runner finished over ten seconds in front of the rest of the field with silver medalist C Chanthini of Kerala clocking a time of 4:48.48. Bronze medal winner Akanksha Gaikwad of Maharashtra was some way further back with a time of 4:52.15.

A closer finish was to be found in the boys high jump competition with Vijay Malik of Delhi, Kumar Sanu Giri of Uttar Pradesh and Robindeep Singh Sran of Punjab all clearing a height of 2.01m. With three athletes jumping identical heights, the gold medal was awarded to Malik on the basis of fewest failed jumps. Giri and Sran took silver and third place respectively.

Another close contest took place in the boys long jump competition with just one centimeter separating Kerala’s Mohammad Ashif and Tamil Nadu’s P David. Ashif cleared 7.12m to take the gold medal while David settled for silver with a jump of 7.11m. Pankaj Verma of Haryana won the bronze medal with his very last jump of 7.01m.

It was a close margin that determined the winner of the silver and bronze medals in the girl’s triple jump competition. While the gold medal won by Maharashtra’s Sharvari Parulekar was never in doubt owing to her a best jump of 12.01m, Kerala’s Anu Mathew and Anusha M of Andhra Pradesh both had identical best jumps of 11.82m. It was Mathew who was awarded the silver medal on the basis of a second jump at the same mark, while Anusha’s second best effort was 11.77m.

Haryana athletes Shiksha and Anjali made it a 1-2 finish in the girls shot put event clinching gold and silver with best throws of 14.86m and 13.77m respectively. The third step on the podium was secured by M Sharmila of Tamil Nadu with a best effort of 13.17m.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/vishvendra-harendra-set-meet-records-on-opening-day-of-youth-nationals/,Athletics
Seven meet records fall on final day of NIDJAM in Tirupati,"December 3, 2018","AFI Media
03/12/2018

Tirupati (AP). Records continued to tumble on the final day of the National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet that concluded in the city of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh on Monday. Seven new meet records were set at the Tarakarama Stadium in SV University after five were set on the second day of competition on Sunday.

Sneha Malik who was representing Rohtak district in Haryana shaved over two seconds off the existing meet record in the 1000 m run in the U-16 girls category. Malik clocked a time of 3:00:95 to erase the previous meet record of 3:03:08 set by Ritu Kumari of Dhanbad, Jharkhand at the 2013 edition of the NIDJAM. Coming in second place was Shraddha Hake of Solapur, Maharashtra who recorded a time of 3:03.28 seconds. The bronze medal was claimed by Bhagya Lakshmi of Nagakurnool, Telengana who crossed the finish line in 3:06:77 seconds.

Asha Kiran Barla also wrote her name into the record books. The 12-year-old athlete from Ranchi district in Jharkhand stopped the clock at 1:38:01 seconds to claim the gold medal in the U-14 girls 600m race. She finished over a second clear of the previous meet record of 1:39:12 seconds set two years ago at the Vishakapatnam edition of the NIDJAM. Barla was followed on the podium by Moumita Roy of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal. Roy finished a distant second clocking a time of 1:44:97 seconds. The bronze medal was secured by Ekta Dey of Bhopal district, MP who finished with a time of 1:45:18 seconds.

It took a meet record for Sandeep Kumar to win a gold medal in the U-16 boys high jump. Kumar, representing Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh cleared a height of 1.93m to edge out Kushal Mohite and Kaushik Jadhav who were representing Satara Maharashtra and Botad district in Gujarat respectively. Mohite and Jadhav both cleared identical heights of 1.89m with the Maharashtra jumper taking the silver medal by virtue of making fewer failed jumps.

Meet records were also made in the course of determining the fastest 14 year old athletes in the country. The boys U-14 100m race was won by Dhiraj Kumar Pahadi of Dhanbad district, Jharkhand wo clocked a time of 11.19 seconds. He erased the previous meet record of 11.26 seconds set last year at Vishakapatnam. He was closely followed by Mukesh Kumar of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand and Ravi Kushwaha of Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh who clocked times of 11.50 seconds and 11.67 seconds respectively.

The 100 m race in the girls U-14 cateogry was won by Sakshi Chavan of Aurangabad, Maharashtra who crossed the finish line in a time of 12.38 seconds. She pipped to the post Aishwarya More of Nasik, Maharashtra and Siya Sawant of Mumbai Suburb, Maharashtra. More clocked a time of 12.85 seconds while Siya Sawant finished with a time of 13.00 seconds.

Aniket Chaudhary and Rithika R were the other two athletes to set meet records, setting new marks in the 200m race in the boys U-16 category and the 100m hurdles race in the girls U-16 category respectively. Chaudhary clocked a time of 22.62 seconds to erase the previous mark of 22.79 seconds set last year at Visakhaptnam. Rithika meanwhile crossed the finish line in 14.78 seconds to eclipse the previous meet record of 15.09 seconds set last year.

Organised by Andhra Pradesh Government with the support of local administration, the Tirupati edition of AFI’s annual mega event witnessed participation of more than 4200 junior athletes from 436 districts of the country. More than 5000 officials were deployed by the local organising committee to support the needs of the athletes. Bengaluru based NEB Sports sponsored the travel of all the athletes and the coaches.

AFI deputed National Youth Coach Subhash George and Dronacharya Award winner coaches Robert Bobby George and N Ramesh as scouts to spot the talented kids. A team of coaches from Khelo India also attended the three-day meet for talent hunt.

"Swapna, Arpinder add two more gold medals to India’s tally","August 29, 2018","AFI Media
29 August 2018

Jakarta (Indonesia). Swapna Barman won the first-ever Asian Games gold for India in the women’s heptathlon event in Jakarta on Wednesday. The 21-year old wrapped up the title by finishing the 800 metres race in a time of 2:21.13. Barman finished with 6026 points, an overall best for her, beating the 5942 points at the Asian Athletics Championships in Bhubaneswar in 2017 last year.

In the morning, Barman had topped the Javelin Throw event by throwing 50.63 metres, adding third personal best to her collection and put some distance between herself and her rivals. Purnima Hembram, the other Indian in the event came fourth overall with 5837 points.

Earlier, Arpinder Singh won the men’s Triple Jump competition with an attempt of 16.77 metres. Arpinder, who had finished fifth in Incheon in 2014, set the mark on his 3rd attempt, to take the title. He also became the first man in 48 years since Mohinder Singh Gill (1970) to win the Triple Jump title at the Asian Games.

Arpinder, the Federation Cup champion, had also made the 3rd highest jump of the competition with his second attempt of 16.58 metres. Rakesh Babu, also competing in the final jumped 16.40 metres to finish sixth in the final.

Dutee Chand became only the 4th Indian to win a medal in the 100 and 200 metres, as she followed up her silver in the 100 with another in the 200. Chand, courtesy of her second silver, became the first Indian since PT Usha in 1986 to win a medal in both the 100 and 200.

The 800 metres gold medallist, Manjit Singh stayed on course for a middle distance double as he topped his heat in the 1500 metres. The silver medallist in the half-mile, Jinson Johnson, also qualified for the final as he was second in the other heat.

The Indian men’s 4×400 relay team also qualified for the final as the quartet of Kunhu Mohammed, Jeevan KS, Jithu Baby and Dharun Ayyasamy finished second in their heat with a time of 3:06.48, finishing behind Japan.

India also lost their appeal against an infringement by Bahrain in the 4×400 metres mixed relay. As a result, they did not upgrade on their silver medal.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Swapna-Arpinder-add-two-more-gold-medals-to-India’s-tally.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/swapna-arpinder-add-two-more-gold-medals-to-indias-tally/,Athletics
"All eyes on Hima, Anas ahead of Inter State athletics","June 25, 2018","AFI Media
25 June 2018

Guwahati. With spots in the Indian squad for the 2018 Asian Games up for grabs, the 58th National Inter State Athletics Championships, beginning June 26th in Guwahati, is expected to be a keenly contested affair.

While a few high profile names including Commonwealth gold medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and Commonwealth silver medalist discus thrower Seema Antil have been granted exemption from participation, the track section of the four day long competition should likely throw up some big results.  This will be largely due to the strict qualification guidelines — equivalent to top-4 or top-5 performance of the last Asian Games in almost all the events – and the fact that several athletes have been delivering strong performances in recent weeks.

Multiple Asian gold medalist PT Usha said the women’s 400m would in particular be an event to watch out for. “The competition in certain track events will be really strong here in Guwahati as athletes are well prepared. Since it is the final selection trial, athletes are determined to give their best. Hima Das has produced some really good results this year and I hope she will continue this for the rest of the season,” Usha said.

The 18-year-old Das is expected to be the highlight of what will be her home event. Das has improved dramatically in recent months. The Assam sprinter clocked a personal best of 23.22 seconds in the 200m in Poland earlier this month while she ran 51.32 seconds in 400m during the Gold Coast CWG. “”I have just returned from Poland where we went for month long training and I am feeling good. I am fully prepared for Inter State,” Das said.

Yet Das will face tough competition in both events. In 200m, she will compete against the likes of Dutee Chand and Srabani Nanda  while Asian championship gold medalist Nirmala Sheoran, who has a personal best of 51.28 seconds,  is expected to pose a serious threat. With veterans M R Poovamma and Jauna Murmu coming into form and teenager Jisna Mathew fresh off a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships, there are sure to be fireworks on the track.

Amongst the athletes to watch out for in the men’s section will be quartermiler Muhammad Anas. The 23-year-old who broke the national record during the Gold Coast CWG with an effort of 45.31 seconds, will also be competing in the 200m.

The results of the two 400m races will be particularly fascinating owing to the fact that the selectors would also be picking the team for the 4x400m mixed relay, to be held for the first time at the Asian Games this time. India has a decent chance to win a gold in this event.

In the long-distance section, plenty of eyes would be on 21-year-old Gavit Murli Kumar, who became the second fastest Indian in 10,000m with a 28:43.34 sec effort at the Gouden Spike Meet earlier this month, would want to show that his impressive display was no fluke. Murli, who is also competing in the 5000m race, though will not have it easy with double Asian gold medalist G Lakshmanan and T Gopi also in the fray.

An additional item of interest to the competition would be the return to the track of steeplechaser Lalita Babar. The 29-year-old former Asian Games bronze medalist had been out of action for over a year following her marriage but will be hoping to make up for lost time at the Indira Gandhi athletics stadium.

“We are expecting a very high level of competition this year in Inter State championships. The weather in Guwahati is perfect for athletes. I want to thank Honorable CM of Assam Shri Sarbananda Sonwal for providing such good facilities to all the teams and our National Campers here in Guwahati,” said CK Valson.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/All-eyes-on-Hima-Anas-ahead-of-Inter-State-athletics.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/all-eyes-on-hima-anas-ahead-of-inter-state-athletics/,Athletics
"Kamalraj, Ajit win gold to round up India Junior campaign in Japan","June 10, 2018","AFI Media
10 June 2018

Gifu, Japan. India saved their best for the last day of competition at the 2018 Junior Asian Athletics Championships in Gifu, Japan as they won two gold medals, a silver and a bronze on Sunday.

Kamalraj Kanagaraj and Ajit Kumar won gold medals in the men’s triple jump and 5000m, the Indian women’s 4x400m team claimed a silver while Jisna Mathew took home her second individual medal and third overall of the competition – a bronze – in the women’s 200m race.

At the end of four days of competition, India returned a total medal haul of 17 medals including five gold, two silver and 10 bronze medals.

With a personal best of 16.41m, and coming off a gold medal winning effort of 16.05m at the Junior South Asian Championships last month, 19-year-old Kamalraj Kanagaraj was widely expected to perform well at the Asian Junior Championships. Those hopes nearly faded after he suffered an injury scare and walked away from the competition after suffering ankle pain on his third of six attempts at the Gifu Nagaragawa Stadium. However, just his first jump of 15.75m would be more than enough to seal victory.  He beat out Korea’s Gyumin Yu and Japan’s Syunsuke Izumiya who managed to leap 15.56m and 15.47m, respectively.

While Kanagaraj’s gold came despite less than optimum showing, compatriot Ajit Kumar had to produce a personal best in order to win the men’s 5000m race. The Allahabad based athlete clocked 14:15.24 seconds to improve on his previous best time of 14:38.10 recorded at the Federation Cup in Patiala in March this year. The 19-year-old athlete nearly set a new national mark but eventually fell short of the 22-year-old mark of 14:14.48seconds set by Gojen Singh in 1996. His time in Giju though was more than enough to place him on top of the podium, well ahead of Japan’s Ren Tazawa and Iranian Seyedamir Zamanpur who clocked 14:17.26 and 14:25.25 seconds respectively. Kumar’s mark was his second personal best effort of the competition. He had earlier clocked 3:51.62 seconds in the men’s 1500m race but that mark was only good enough to secure the sixth place in the final.

India had entered the women’s 4x400m relay with history on their side. However, Indian hopes for a winning a third straight gold medal in the event at the Junior Asian Championships were dashed as they were pipped to the finish by the Japanese relay team. The Indian squad comprising Jisna Mathew, Subha Venkatesan, Nidhi Yogendra Singh and Rachna clocked a time of 3:41.11 seconds to finish nearly three seconds behind the Japanese relay squad of Ayano Shiomi, Kasumi Yoshida, Natsumi Murakami and Ayaka Kawata who set a new championship record with a time of 3:38.20 seconds. Taking third spot on the podium was Sri Lanka whose quartet clocked 3:45.16 seconds.

While the silver was India’s final medal of the competition, it had followed a bronze medal won by the standout Indian performer of the Championhips. A product of the PT Usha Academy, Jisna Mathew, who had earlier won a gold medal in the women’s 400m earlier in the competition found herself on the podium in the women’s 200m as well. Mathew fell short of her personal best of 23.97seconds as she clocked 24.48 seconds on Sunday to finish behind China’s Yanan Tao and Sri Lanka’s Amasha De Silva who clocked 24.01seconds and 24.47 seconds. Mathew could have won a silver medal if she had just had a better start on the day. The India’s reaction time was .230 seconds – the third slowest in the 8-athlete final – and .06 seconds slower than Sri Lanka’s De Silva.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kamalraj-Ajit-win-gold-to-round-up-India-Junior-campaign-in-Japan.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/kamalraj-ajit-win-gold-to-round-up-india-junior-campaign-in-japan/,Athletics
"Jisna clinches gold, Sreesankar makes a comeback with a bronze","June 8, 2018","AFI Media
08 June 2018

Gifu, Japan. Quarter miler Jisna Matthew led India’s charge on the second day of the 2018 Asian Junior Athletics Championships winning a gold medal in the women’s 400m race. Five other Indian athletes would win  bronze medals on Friday as India took their medal tally to two gold medals, one silver and seven bronze medals after two days of competition n Gifu, Japan.

Mathew had gone into the competition as the pre-race favourite and was defending her title from the 2016 edition of the Asian Junior Championships in Ho Chi Minh City. Jisna, a PT Usha trainee with a personal best of 52.65 seconds, had already won a senior Asian Championships bronze medal as well as a gold medal in the relay in the same competition and represented India at the IAAF World championships in 2017. She was also part of the Indian women’s 4x400m relay team at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

The Junior competition on offer at the Gifu Nagaragawa Stadium posed little threat to her. Mathew clocked 53.26 seconds to finish well ahead of Dilshi Kumarasinghe of Sri Lanka who clocked 54.03 seconds. Taking bronze was Jui-Hsuan Yang of Chinese Taipei who recorded at time of 54.74 seconds.

Junior National record holder M Sreeshankar didn’t come close to matching his personal best of 7.99m in the long jump competition but still took back a bronze medal after clearing a distance of 7.47m. Sreeshankar, who nearly touched the 8m mark at the Federation Cup in Patiala in March this year, had to step back after being diagnosed with appendicitis the same month. In Gifu, Sreeshankar was in fifth place after three attempts before clearing 7.47m in his fourth attempt of the competition to overtake Yu-Tang Lin of Chinese Taipei who had cleared 7.46m. Gold went to Japan’s Yugo Sakai (7.61m) while China’s Keqi Zhou (7.54m) took silver.

Shot putter Ajay Bhalothia won his second medal at the Asian Junior Championships after having claimed a silver medal at the 2016 edition. Bhalothia hurled the 6kg iron ball a distance of 18.22m to finish behind Qatar’s Moaaz Mohamed Ibrahim (18.57m) and South Korea’s Yeo Jinseong (18.25m). After recording two poor throws of 15.79m and 16.45m early on, Bhalothia recovered with the 18.22m effort in his third attempt before clearing 18m (18.02m and 18.14m) in his subsequent two throws. However, Bhalothia who has a personal best of 18.53m, registered a foul throw in his final attempt to end any chance of improving the color of his medal.

While Bhalothia fell short of his personal best, it took a career high effort from high jumper Abhinaya Sudhakara Shetty to step on the podium. Shetty cleared 1.75m to claim bronze. Just last month she had cleared 1.60m to win a bronze at the South Asia Junior Championships in Colombo. In Gifu, Shetty began with that mark before clearing heights of 1.65m, 1.69m, 1.72m and subsequently 1.75m. Shetty made three attempts at 1.78m but failed to clear that mark. She finished behind Ching Jung Tsai of Chinese Taipei (1.78m) while Iraq’s Maryam Abdulhameed Abdulelah took gold with a clearance at 1.80m.

India’s final two bronze medals came from Kartik Kumar in the men’s 10000m and Durga Pramod Deore in the women’s 1500m race respectively. The men’s 10000m race was a closely fought affair with a wide gap between the medalists and the rest of the pack. Kumar, clocked a personal best of 30.05.30seconds to finish well ahead of fourth placed Japanese Takuro Miuka who finished with a time of 30.55.80 seconds. Kumar though was beaten to silver by Yuhi Nakaya (30.04.24 seconds) while Suolangcairen of China took gold with a time of 30.01.51 seconds.

In the women’s 1500m race, Deore improved on the 4.31.38 she had clocked at the South Asia Junior championships in May. Deore’s time of 4.24.56 was enough to get her on the podium behind the Japanese pair of Tomomi Musembi Takamatsu (4.21.65seconds) and Ririka Hironaka (4.17.62 seconds)",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jisna-clinches-gold-Sreesankar-makes-a-comeback-with-a-bronze.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/jisna-clinches-gold-sreesankar-makes-a-comeback-with-a-bronze/,Athletics

New Delhi. Quarter miler Jisna Mathew, triple jumper Kamalraj Kanagraj, shot putter Ashish Bhalothia and Ashish Jhakhar are some of the top names in the 51-member Indian contingent selected for 18th Asian Junior Athletics Championships to be held at Gifu, Japan from 7-10 June 2018.

The Indian team consists of 30 junior men and 21 junior women athletes.

Having finished overall third with 17 medals that included seven gold, four silver and six bronze medals at the last edition of the championships in Vietnam two years ago, India is hopeful of improving its ranking this year as a result of rising number of talented athletes at junior level.

“We have a good number of upcoming junior athletes. A lot of these juniors are part of our core group and they train in senior camps. Sreeshankar, Jisna and Kamalraj have also competed at senior level and performed well. We are expecting a good show from our athletes in Gifu,” said CK Valson, Secretary AFI.

Jisna Mathew, a PT Usha trainee with a personal best of 52.65s, has won a senior Asian championships bronze medal and represented India at the IAAF World championships in 2017. She was also part of the Indian women’s 4x400m relay team at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

In triple jump Tamil Nadu’s Kamalraj with a personal best of 16.41 has emerged as one of the most promising junior athlete. At senior level, Kamalraj represented India at 2018 Asian Indoors in Iran earlier this year and bagged a silver medal with a jump of 16.23m.

Javelin thrower Sanjana defends junior Federation Cup title,"April 20, 2018","20 April 2018

Coimbatore (TN). Under18 National champion Ankit of Haryana, came close to setting a meet record during his gold medal winning run in the men’s U20 1500m race at the 16th Federation Cup National Junior Athletics Championships in Coimbatore on Firday. Ankit, clocked 3:51.81 seconds to fall just short of the old meet record of 3:51:16 seconds set by Shashi Bhushan Singh in 2015. Ankit though was well clear of the field, finishing well ahead of Ajit Kumar of Gujarat, who clocked 3:53:21 seconds to take silver. Bronze went to Kerala’s Abhinath Sundaresan, who finished with a time of 3:53:23 seconds. Sundaresan would be disappointed by the performance considering he is the reigning national champion in the event.

Defending champion – Sanjana Choudhary in the U20 women’s javelin throw — had better fortune. Choudhary, who claimed gold in the 2017 edition in Lucknow, took the same title with ease at Coimbatore. Choudhary threw the spear a distance of 46.97m to finish ahead of Hemamalini Neelakandan of Tamil Nadu who had a best effort of 43.14m. Jyoti of Haryana, took the final place on the podium with an effort of 42.89m.

Kiran Baliyan claimed the women’s U20 shot put event with a throw of 15.23m. The throw, one of only two legal throws made by the athlete from UP, failed to come close to the national record of 15.89m set by Commonwealth bronze medallist Navjeet Dhillon, but it was still well clear of the efforts of statemate Anamika Das, who took silver with a throw of 13.83m. Kachnar Choudhary of Rajasthan took bronze with a throw of 13.52m.

3000m Junior National Champion Gupreet Singh too added a Federation Cup medal to his name. Gurpreet, who claimed the 3000m title in the U18 category, was competing in the U20 5000m race in Coimbatore. He won with a time of 14:46:51 seconds. He finished ahead of UP’s Ajay Kumar Bind and Maharashtra’s Dinesh Kumar, who clocked 14:53:65 seconds and 14:59:44 seconds respectively.

Making the step up to a higher age group would however be difficult for Seema of Himachal Pradesh. The athlete who had won the 3000m women’s U18 title at the Vijaywada Nationals in 2017, could only finish second best in the U20 category in the same event at the Federation Cup. She clocked 9:51:04 seconds to take silver behind Poonam Sonune of Maharashtra who clocked 9:50:61 seconds. Bronze went to Savita Pal of Assam, who finished a distant third with a time of 10:16:16 seconds.

Roji Patel was the only other gold medal winner on a day when four finals were washed out due to rain and bad light. The athlete from Assam won the women’s U20 10000m race walk event with a time of 51:44:52 seconds. She finished ahead of Manju Rani of Gujarat and Sneha of Haryana, who clocked 51:55:07 seconds and 52:08:13 seconds, respectively.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Javelin-thrower-Sanjana-defends-junior-Federation-Cup-title.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/javelin-thrower-sanjana-defends-junior-federation-cup-title/,Athletics

The 19-year-old Matthew, who trains at the PT Usha Academy has been touted for big things by her legendary mentor.  Mathews, who runs the quarter mile, has beaten some of the biggest names in the sport in India, including former Asian silver medallist, MR Poovamma at the Indian GP last season. Indeed, at the Asian Championships in Bhubaneshwar last year, Mathews won a surprise bronze in what was her biggest medal to date.

Mathew has had her share of success at the age group events too having won gold in the 400m at the Asian Junior championships in 2016. Jisna though has never medalled at the world stage, a gap in her resume that her coaches say she might soon fill in. “Her main goal is to win a medal at next year’s under-20 Worlds. And I feel she is capable of getting it,” says Usha.

The Federation Cup will be the first step towards that goal. The event will serve as a qualification for the 3rd South Asian Athletics Championships (Colombo, Sri Lanka 5-6 May 2018) and 18th Asian Junior Athletics Championships (Gifu, Japan 7-10 June 2018).

Mathews though is just one of an estimated 600+ athletes who will be taking part in the Federation Cup, all looking to record personal best performances. Plenty of eyes would be on Punjab hammer thrower Damneet Singh. The Punjab hammer thrower has already written his name in the record books, when he became the first Indian athlete to medal at the U18 World Championships courtesy his silver at the 2017 edition. However, he is unlikely to be satisfied with that performance and will be looking to begin the task of upgrading his medal from Nairobi last year.

The hammer throw field will in fact be a crowded one at Coimbatore. Apart from Damneet, Haryana thrower Ashish Jhakhar and Rajasthan’s Nitish Punia would also be looking to book their place in the Indian team in an effort to do better at the World level from the last time they featured at that stage. While Jhakar had a gold medal at the Asian Junior Championships in 2016, he failed to medal at the World Championships that year. Punia too had competed alongside Damneet at Nairobi but only finished tenth in the competition.

Also looking to make a mark will be 800m runner Abhishek Mathew. The 16-year-old from Kannur, Kerala won a gold medal at the Asian Youth Championships in Bangkok last year, and also took fourth place at the 2016 World School Championships in Trabzon, Turkey.

Abhishek won the 800m gold medal in Bangkok with a time of 1:54:99 seconds, which he subsequently improved to 1:52:88 seconds. However, he is unlikely to be satisfied with that effort.  Not long after he had recorded his personal best, Mathew had revealed his targets for 2018. “My immediate goal is to win medals in Asian junior (U-20 meet) and World Junior Championships next year,” he had said. The path to those tournaments will run through the Junior Federation Cup.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jisna-Damneet-to-star-in-Junior-Federation-Cup.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/jisna-damneet-to-star-in-junior-federation-cup/,Athletics
"Ayyasamy sets National Record, Arpinder qualifies in triple jump for CWG","March 8, 2018","AFI Media
08 March 2018

Patiala. Dharun Ayyasamy of Tamil Nadu delivered the performance of his career as he shattered the 11-year old national record in the men’s 400m hurdles at the Run Adam Federation Cup at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Thursday.

Ayyasamy, who was part of the Indian 4x400m relay team at the Rio Olympics, crossed the finish line in the hurdles event in 49.45 seconds to erase the old mark of 49.51 seconds set by Joseph Abraham in Osaka in 2007.

The time Ayyasamy clocked was immediately significant for it was matched the qualifying guidelines of 49.45 seconds set by the AFI to determine the Indian team for the Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast.

Ayyasamy’s performance was all the more impressive for it came with the athlete still recovering from a serious illness. “I am really happy with the result,” Ayyasamy said after the win. “I was suffering from typhoid till ten days before of IGP. But i have worked hard with my coach to recover and train. It is a very good feeling to break national record and qualify for CWG,” he said. Ayyasamy finished ahead of statemates T Santosh Kumar (50.14seconds) and M Ramachandran (51.61 seconds).

Arpinder Singh, earned the right to improve on the bronze medal he won in the triple jump at the Glasgow Games in 2014 by clearing 16.61m to finish 1 cm above the qualifying guidelines of 16.60m set by the AFI. Arpinder was in danger of finishing outside the qualification guidelines but managed to find the mark in his fifth jump which was also his final legal jump of the competition.

Hima Das of Assam, who had already qualified in the women’s 400m race earlier, blitzed the field in the 200m event winning in a credible time of 23.37seconds which was just.07 seconds shy of the meet record of 23.30 set by PT Usha in 1998. Although Das also missed the CWG qualifying guidelines of 22.60 seconds, it was a credible performance by the 18 year old who finished more than a second clear of second place PJ Sneha (24.47 seconds).

Another strong performance that fell short of the CWG qualifying guidelines came in the 1500m through Jinson Johnson. Johnson clocked 3.39:69 seconds that was just .19 seconds shy of the qualifying guidelines of3:39:50 seconds. Johnsons mark was also a new meet record, erasing the old mark of 3:41:12 seconds recorded 11 years ago by Chatholi Hamza. Johnson finished ahead of Manjit Singh and Bir Singh who clocked 3:42:24 seconds and 3:42:28 seconds respectively.

"Lakshmanan, Suriya, Hima, Sheena lead Indian gold medal run at Asian Games test event","February 13, 2018","Jakarta, Feb13: Lakshmanan Govindan and Loganathan Suriya made it two in two for India in the 5000m at the athletics event of the Asian Games invitational tournament in Jakarta on Tuesday. Govindan, who hails from Pudukottai in Tamil Nadu had been adopted by Suriya’s father – the athletics coach S Loganathan. He has long carved a niche for himself as India’s premier long distance runner and is the current Asian champion in the 5000 and 10000m. The 28-year-old added to his already impressive body of work at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium. Competing in his first tournament of the season Lakshmanan clocked 13.56.30 seconds to finish ahead of Takanori Ichikawa of Japan who was nearly a half minute behind with a time of 14:19:10 seconds.

Suriya on the other hand was the only runner in the field. Without anyone to push or pace her, the 28-year-old might hardly have expected to challenge herself. However, Suriya recorded a career best time of 15:39:18secands, shaving nearly seven seconds of her previous best of 15:46:92 seconds recorded in Guntur last year. The mark was good enough to allow her to meet the Asian Games qualification standard of 15 minutes 45 seconds. However Suriya’s target for now would be next month’s Federation Cup which will serve as a qualification tournament for the Commonwealth Games. With the cream of Indian athletes taking part, Suriya would be able to push herself even further.

Lakshmanan and Suriya’s gold medals were just two of the four gold medals India won on the third day of athletics events in Jakarta. NV Sheena claimed a gold medal in the women’s triple jump while Hima Das finished ahead of the field in the women’s 200m race. Das, is one of the brightest talents in the women’s sprints events having finished fifth in the women’s 200m at Youth World championships in Nairobi last year. She is also won the National Open Championships. In Jakarta, the 18-year-old Das would clock 23.59 seconds to finish ahead of Ulfa Silpiana of Indonesia who was nearly a second behind with 24.86. Das, competing in her first tournament of the year recorded a new career best, beating her previous fastest mark of 24. 26 recorded at the National Open Athletics Championships in Chennai last year.

NV Sheena was always ahead of the field in the women’s triple jump and was well clear of the pack with her second jump of 13.33m. Sri Lanka’s Vidusha Heenatimullage came close with her final attempt of 13.28m but no other jumper crossed the 13m mark. It was the second medal for the 26-year-old Sheena who has had a prolific year having won the silver medal, also in the triple jump at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in February.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/11-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/lakshmanan-suriya-hima-sheena-lead-indian-gold-medal-run-at-asian-games-test-event/,Athletics

AFI Media

Patiala: India’s top track and field athletes will be in action at the NS-NIS here in Patiala during the 21st Federation Cup Senior Athletics Championships which will kick-off on Thursday morning.

The championships which will provide an opportunity to Indian athletes to qualify for the upcoming Asian Athletics Championships to be held in Bhubaneswar from 6-9 July 2017 will begin with the Women and Men 5000m finals.

More than 700 athletes from around the country have registered for the prestigious athletics event organised by Athletics Federation of India (AFI) every year.

In a message to the athletes, Adille J Sumariwalla, AFI President, said, “I wish all the athletes a great competition. I hope some records will be broken in Patiala. AFI is glad to receive such a large number of entries even though we had to change the venue from Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi to Patiala at the last moment. We were compelled to take this decision as throwing events were not allowed inside JLN due to preparations for the FIFA U-17 World Cup to be hosted by India later this year,”

“AFI is thankful to Punjab Athletics Association and Sports Authority of India for their support and making the last-minute arrangements for the competition,” said AFI President.

Some of the top athletes who will be in action during the four-day meet in Patiala are Neeraj Chopra (Javelin Throw), Ankit Sharma (Long Jump), Tintu Luka (800m), Sudha Singh (3000m SC) and Irfan K T (20km Race Walk) to name a few.

Addressing the media during a press conference on Wednesday, PT Usha, former Olympian and coach of top Indian runners such as Olympian Tintu Luka and Jisna Mathew said, “Weather is hot in Patiala but it is not an issue as athletes are used to perform in such conditions. We are ready for the competition.”

Neeraj Chopra, current World Junior record holder in javelin throw, said, “I have already qualified for the IAAF World Championships 2017 but I am participating in this prestigious competition to improve my performance. In javelin throw, the standard is continuously going up in India so it will be a good competition for all athletes. I will try to do my best in this competition.”

Besides, Men and Women 5000m, the other medal events on the opening day of the competition are 400m hurdles (Men & Women) and Women Shot put, High Jump and Hammer Throw.",Usha,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/top-indian-athletes-in-patiala-for-federation-cup/,Athletics

All eyes were on Jisna and Karnataka athlete Poovamma Raju’s contest in the final leg as Keralite has lost to Poovamma in a photo finish with just 0.01s difference in the second leg of IGP, five days ago.
Today, Povamma followed Jisna to clinch the silver with the timing of 52.73s and Debashree Mazumdar (53.69s) won the bronze medal.

Jisna along with Tintu Lukka has been training under legendary Indian athlete P.T. Usha at the Usha School of Athletics. Jisna was first picked from a selection trial conducted by the Usha School of Athletics in 2011 and is one of the athletes the coach believes has untapped potential.

In Men’s 110m Hurdles, Akhil who hails from Kerala bagged the gold medal clocking 14.44s. He was followed by Tamil Nadu’s T.Balamurugan with 14.58s and Kerala’s Sreekanth with 14.82s won the silver and bronze medals respectively.

Purnima Hembram from Orissa who seized the gold medal clocking 13.85s in the IGP leg-1 at Patiala, a week ago added another gold medal to her account in the Women’s 100m Hurdles by bettering her performance to 13.79s.

"Meet OLLY- the turtle, Mascot of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships","May 7, 2017","May 07, 2017, Bhubaneswar: The Local Organising Committee of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships 2017 today unveiled the logo and mascot of the championships in a glittering ceremony held at the Kalinga Stadium Complex in Bhubaneshwar on Sunday, 07 May 2017.

Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha, Shri Naveen Patnaik, unveiled the logo and mascot during the official announcement ceremony of the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships 2017.
While logo depicts an athlete crossing the finishing line with historical tourist attractions of Odisha in the background, the mascot of the meet is an Olive Ridley Sea turtle named OLLY. Beaches of Odisha are a prime nesting site for these endangered sea turtles.

Speaking at the gathering, Hon’ble Chief Minister of Odisha said, “I am delighted to be here today to announce that Bhubaneshwar will be hosting the 22nd Asian Athletics Championships. This will be the largest ever sporting event in Bhubaneshwar with participation of 45-countries. More than 700 athletes will participate in 42 athletics event spread over 4 days from 6-9 July, 2017 here at the Kalinga Stadium”.

“Bhubaneshwar has emerged as a sought-after destination for international competitions. The city is also going to host the Hockey World League Final in December 2017 and the prestigious Men’s Hockey World Cup in December 2018. I am sure, these athletics championships will provide substantial exposure to Odia boys and girls who will be watching World Champions in action.

“Kalinga Stadium is being transformed into a world class infrastructure facility for hosting international events as per requirements of International Association of Athletics Federation. All necessary steps are being taken to ensure a pleasant experience for the players, officials and visitors,”

In the 22nd edition of the biggest Athletics meet of Asia, around 700 athletes from 45 Asian countries will participate. The championships will also serve as a qualifying event for the IAAF World Championships 2017 to be held in London in August.

Lauding the efforts being put in by the Odisha Government to host the championships after Ranchi pulled-out few months back, Adille J. Sumariwalla, Athletics Federation of India (AFI), said, “Today, we are all gathered here to take that first step towards realising the idea we have all conceived together. To announce to the world, to announce to the Asian family and most importantly to the people of Odisha, that Kalinga Stadium would be the place where best of the Asian athletes will compete for a berth in the IAAF World Championships,

“When a month ago I came here with the proposal and Odisha said,” Okay, let’s do it.” I myself had doubts how we will be able to do it in such a short time. But today, on Sunday, 7th May 2017, having spent time with the team that is working day and night to make it possible, I can confidently say that the 22nd Asian Athletics Championship will be the best ever Asian athletics meet planned and delivered in such a short span of time”.

“Through these beautifully designed Logo & Mascot, the Championships has now got an identity. The logo and mascot will generate awareness amongst the masses and create a sense of belongingness to the Championships. While the Logo represents the beautiful state of Odisha and the passion to win in everything we do, the Mascot represents the endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtles whose biggest home is at the Gahirmatha Beach in Odisha. It is indeed a great idea that through this meet we will be contributing towards raising an awareness about preserving the habitat of these beautiful creatures who co-exist with us on this planet”.

Today’s ceremony was also attended by newly appointed Minister of Sports & Youth Services Department of Odisha Shri Chandra Sarathi Behra, former Olympians P.T. Usha and Anju Bobby George, C.K.

Indian Athletics Legend Milkha Singh Passes Away,"June 19, 2021","AFI Media
New Delhi, 19 June 2021:

Track legend Milkha Singh’s passing plunged the Indian sports community into gloom. One of the country’s earliest sports heroes, he died of Covid-related complications in a private hospital in Chandigarh late on Friday night, leaving the athletics community in shock and disbelief.

Athletics Federation of India President Adille J. Sumariwalla led the condolences from the track and field community. “A Titan who lifted the profile of athletics in a young nation, his sharp observations on Indian sport will be missed. His towering legacy will continue to inspire generations of young Indians,” he said.

“It is hard to reconcile to the news that Milkha Singh is no more. We always believed he would return from hospital and cheer our athletes as they prepared for the Olympic Games in Tokyo next month,” Mr. Sumariwalla said, reflecting the emotions of the athletics family encompassing several generations and including the whole country.

Born on 17th October 1935, in Govindpuri, which is now in Pakistan, he moved to Delhi in the aftermath of the Partition in 1947 when several members of his family were killed before his eyes. For him to have escaped that and risen to be a national icon in just over 13 years is ample evidence of the grit and determination that backed his natural talent as a sprinter.

He had a personal best of 20.7 seconds in 200m in Lahore on January 31, 1960. It set him up for a gallant show in the Rome Olympic Games where he clocked a National Record time of 45.6 seconds in the 400m final on September 6. He took part in his third Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 as a part of the 4x400m relay team.

Besides his 1960 Olympic Games heroics, Milkha Singh will be remembered his victory in the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff. He won gold in the 440-yard sprint in a Games Record time of 46.6 seconds. He was the first Indian to win a gold medal in the
Earlier that year, in the Tokyo Asian Games, he won the 200-400m double. He picked up two gold medals in the 1962 Asian Games to end his career on a high.

He was given the tag of Flying Sikh by Pakistan’s Gen. Ayub Khan in 1960 when the Indian ace beat Pakistan’s Abdul Khaliq in a race in Lahore.",Milkha Singh,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/milkha-singh-AFI-Condoles-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indian-athletics-legend-milkha-singh-passes-away/,Athletics
AFI Condoles death of Gentle Giant Praveen Kumar Sobti,"February 8, 2022","AFI Media

New Delhi, February 8: Athletics Federation of India today condoled the death of the gentle giant Praveen Kumar Sobti at 74 years of age. The two-time Asian Games Discus Throw gold medal and Commonwealth Games Hammer Throw silver medal passed away after a cardiac arrest on Monday evening.

AFI President Adille J. Sumariwalla said Indian Athletics had lost a wonderful ambassador in the death of Praveen Kumar Sobti. “He will remain an inspiration for years to come as he is a great example of an athlete who gave his best on the international platform in the 11 years that he competed at the highest level,” he said.

Hailing from a humble family in Sarhali Kalan village, 50km south of Amritsar, Praveen Kumar Sobti rose to win the 1966 Commonwealth Games Hammer Throw silver medal in Kingston. It was India’s maiden medal in a field event in the Commonwealth Games and only the second in athletics after Milkha Singh’s 440 yard gold in 1958.

Standing over 2m tall, he won Asian Games Discus Throw gold in Bangkok in 1966 and 1970, adding the Hammer Throw bronze in 1966 and Discus Throw Silver in 1974 in Tehran. In the Olympic Games competition in 1968 in Mexico City and 1972 in Munich, he produced his career best Hammer Throw (60.84m) and Discus Throw (53.12m) respectively.

“It is this quality of raising his game at the biggest of stages that made Praveen Kumar the top-notch performer,” Mr. Sumariwalla said. “To have achieved all this at a time when training for major competition entailed only short stints in a National camp speaks volumes about his natural talent and the passionate fire that drove him to achieve excellence.”",Milkha Singh,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/gentle-giant-Praveen-Kumar-Sobti750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/afi-condoles-death-of-gentle-giant-praveen-kumar-sobti/,Athletics

Gold Coast. Muhammed Anas Yahiya became the first Indian man to qualify for the 400m final at the Commonwealth Games since the legendary Milkha Singh. National record holder Anas, won his semifinal heat in the men’s 400m race with a time a 45.44 seconds to qualify for the Gold Coast CWG2018 final to be held on Tuesday. Anas’ time was slower than the national record of 45.32 seconds but it was enough to mark him the third fastest Indian in a high qualify final field.

Joining Anas in the final of his event was the high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. Competing in his first Commonwealth Games, the 19-year-old did not have to break much sweat as he qualified for the high jump finals having cleared the cutoff of 2.21m. Shankar started with a height of 2.10m and then progressed to 2.15m where he made a single foul jump before clearing that height too. A successful jump at 2.18m was then followed by a missed clearance at 2.21m. There would be no mistake on his second attempt as Shankar made it to the 13-man final.

Hima Das also advanced to the semifinals of the women’s 400m with relative ease. Das, who is only 18 and only began running the 400m a few months ago, ran a fast 52.11 seconds to qualify as the third fastest runner of the last of five heats. Das’ time was close to her personal best of 51.97 seconds and she will only look to improve on that time in the semifinals of her event to be held on Tuesday.

However, India’s wait for a medal in athletics continued into the second day of the competition with Tejinder Pal Toor and L Suriya falling short in the final of the shot put and women’s 10000m event respectively.

Competing in a strong 12-man field, Toor had a poor evening at the Carrara Stadium. At the end of the first three throws, Toor barely made to the final eight (which allowed him to make three more throws. Toor, who threw 19.42m in his third attempt, never managed to exceed that mark, following with throws of 18.87, a foul throw and a last attempt of 18.63m. Toor had a personal best of 20.40m and had qualified for the Games with an effort of 20.24m at the Federation Cup last month but even those would have not been enough on the day with the bronze medal going at 20.91m to Canada’s Tim Nedow. Tomas Walsh and Chupwuebuka Enekwechi won gold and silver at 21.41m and 21.14m respectively.

Loganathan Suriya also finished out of the medal bracket but will have no regrets about her performance in the women’s 10000m. Suriya ran a personal best time of 32.23.56 seconds to finish 13th out of 19 athletes in a very strong field. Even had Suriya matched the national record of 31:50:47 seconds, she would still have finished outside the podium.

Gold Coast (Australia). All eyes will be on Neeraj Chopra ahead of the athletics competitions of the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games. No Indian athlete has ever won a gold in the javelin throw at the Games, but the 20-year-old from the village of Khandra in Haryana’s Panipat district might well break that trend. Chopra, who has a personal best of 86.48m, is coming into the Games with a season’s best of 85.94m. That throw is the best amongst Commonwealth Games this season. Also in Chopra’s favour is the fact that former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott is skipping the games while 2016 Olympic silver medalist Julius Yego of Kenya has been woefully out of form.

Should Chopra win gold, it would be only the fifth ever for India at the games. Only Milkha Singh (440 yards, 1958), women’s 4x400m (2010), Krishna Poonia (women’s discus, 2010) and Vikas Gowda (men’s discus, 2014) have won gold previously.

Chopra is one of several medal winning prospects for the Indian team. Competing in what she says will be her final Commonwealth Games, Seema Punia will be looking to end her journey on a high. The 34-year-old who has won two silver and a bronze medal so far will look to go all out this time around.

Triple jumper Arpinder Singh, who won a bronze medal at the 2014 Games, is also bidding to improve the colour of his prize this time around. “I think gold will go for 17m and I feel I can do it,” said Arpinder, the second best jumper among Commonwealth athletes this season with his 16.61 at the Federation Cup.

Also amongst India’s brightest prospects will be 19-year-old high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. The student of Kansas State University, broke his own national record of 2.26m this year with a jump of 2.28m at the Federation Cup this year. That leap was the best amongst Commonwealth Games athletes this year and he is expecting to improve on that performance at the gold coast games. Tejaswin is one of a new generation of athletes who are making massive strides. 18-year-old Hima Das, who will be competing in the individual 400m as well as the relay and 19-year-old Amoj Jacob, who will be competing in the men’s 400m relay

India could even win their first medal on the opening day of the competition itself in the women’s 20km race walk. Race walker B Soumya set a new national record in the women’s 20km walk. Her time of 1.31.28 seconds is the third best by a Commonwealth athlete this season. India’s athletics campaign at the Games will begin with Men’s 20km walk featuring national record holder Irfan KT and Manish Rawat.

With several Indians up amongst the medal winning bracket, coaches are optimistic about the competition. “We are expecting five to six medals this time but don’t ask me what colour they will be,” deputy chief National coach Radhakrishnan Nair said. “And yes, in terms of number of medals, this promises to be our best ever outside India.”",Milkha Singh,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/16-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/indias-athletics-campaign-begins-tomorrow-at-cwg-2018/,Athletics
"Anas betters his own national record, qualifies for IAAF World Championships 2017","May 15, 2017","May 15, 2017
AFI Media

The third and final leg of the Indian Grand Prix 2017 athletics series concluded successfully at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Delhi on Monday evening, 15 May 2017 as sprinter Muhammed Anas Yahiya shattered his own national record with a flickering timing of 45.32s clinching the gold in Men’s 400m event.

The effort from Keralite also ensured him a berth in the IAAF World Championships 2017 to be held in London from 4-13 August, 2017 for which qualification mark was 45.50s. In June 2016, Anas set the national record with the timing of 45.40s at the Polish Athletics Championships in June 2016.

Rajiv Arokia (46.32s) won the silver while Sachin Baby settled for a bronze medal with the timing of 47.18s.

Anaswas born in a small town of Nilamel in Kerala which is a polestar for talents in athletics and grown up with sports activities around him. His father was also a sprinter during his younger days and the youngster always attempted to fulfill his father’s unaccomplished dreams.

The 22 year old who wanted to be a long-jumper initially, was spotted by physical education instructor, who introduced Anas to athletics when he was less than 10 while he was studying at Mattapally Memorial Higher Secondary School. Ansar noticed the hidden potential in Anas and took him to Kothamangalam where he was introduced to 400m and 400m hurdles.

Soon, the lanky boy was absorbed by Kerala State Sports Council’s elite academy and came under the tutelage of coach P.B.Jaikumar. It was under Jaikumar, Anas made huge strides. He was part of the Kerala’s relay squad that won the silver medal in 4x400m relay in the National Games. There was no looking back for Anas from then on and now he uses all the opportunities that comes on his way to showcase his best to achieve greater heights in his career.

Muhammed Anas was only the third athlete from India to compete in 400m at the Rio Olympics.

India ever had only two runners compete in 400m at the Olympics, the legendary Milkha Singh in 1960 Rome Olympics and K.M.Binu in 2004 Athens Olympics.

Abha Khatua improves national shot put record to 18.41m,"May 13, 2024","Bhubaneswar:

Maharashtra’s Asian silver medalist, Abha Khatua, hogged the limelight on the second day of the 27th National Federation Senior Athletics Competition here on Monday at Bhubaneswar’s Kalinga Stadium. The 28 years old improved women’s shot put record to 18.41m.

The experienced thrower started her Olympic year with a throw of 17.56m in March in Patiala. On Monday she bettered the national record of 18.06m in her fifth attempt (18.41m).

“I have three more domestic competitions in coming weeks. I should be able to further improve my performance,” she said after winning gold with a national record in shot put.

Away from the throwing circle, focus was on Odisha’s promising sprinter Animesh Kujur as he narrowly missed the national record in the men’s 200m. His gold winning time of 20.62 seconds fell short of the national and meet record of 20.52 seconds which are in the name of Amlan Borgohain set in 2022. “I’m happy that I came so close to improving the national record,” the promising Odisha’s sprinter said. He was confident of further improving his performance during upcoming international exposure in Europe. “Will be competing in two-three quality races in Europe, which will be a good chance to break the national record.”

Odisha’s Srabani Nanda wasn’t able to add women’s 200m gold to the team kitty as she was edged past by Karnataka’s promising sprinter Unnati Aiyappa Bolland in the last five meters of an exciting race.

Shaili Singh’s 6.76m and Tajinderpal Singh Toor steal sprinter Amlan Borgohain’s thunder,"April 17, 2023","AFI Media 

Bengaluru, April 15: Uttar Pradesh teenager Shaili Singh leapt into the all-time second place behind her idol Anju Bobby George with a spectacular 6.76m effort in the women’s Long Jump in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics meet at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Saturday.

Later, Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor came up his career’s second best effort, 21.20m to share some of the limelight. Each of his five valid tries went past the 20m line, his best coming at the climax of the competition. It was only the third time that he was able to send the iron ball past the 21m mark after the 21.49m and 21.10m efforts in the span of a week in June 2021 in Patiala. 

Together with Shaili Singh’s brilliance, Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s exhibition of Shot Put under lights stole Amlan Borgohain’s thunder. The Assam sprinter claimed the men’s 100-200 double to hold the attention of the sparse crowd watching the events.

Shaili Singh, 19, improved her personal best by 28cm and catapulted over Aishwaya Babu (6.73), JJ Shobha and V Neena (6.66), Mayookha Johnu (6.64), M Prajusha, Nayana James and Ancy Sojan (6.55) to be behind Anju Bobby George (6.83m) on the all-time list. She qualified for the Asian Games, but fell an agonizing 9cm short of the 2023 World Championships qualifying standard.

Shaili Singh’s domination was so complete that each of her four valid jumps was good enough for het to get gold ahead of Nayana James’s best effort of 6.53m. Shaili Singh’s series read 6.58m, foul, 6.76m, 6.64m, foul and 6.66. It was a veritable demonstration of coach Bobby George’s assertion that his ward was ready to claim the National Record sooner than later.

Amlan Borgohain would not mind conceding the spotlight to her but the way he left the opposition in his wake in the 200m was creditable. The Assam sprinter now owns the three fastest times by Indians in the half-lapper. He set the National Record of 20.52 seconds in the AFI Federation Cup in Kozhikode on April 6 last year and the 20.55 he obtained in the National Games in Gandhinagar on October 4 last. 

Jyothi Yarraji (Andhra Pradesh), the rising track star, lost out on a chance to attain a sprint double when she was disqualified for a foul start in the 100m. However, she overcome that shock and disappointment to win the 200m with a measure of comfort against Archana Suseendran (Tamil Nadu). Running a 200m after a year, she finished in a personal best time of 23.60 seconds. 

Trailing in the fifth place at the bell, Krishan Kumar (Haryana) caught up with race leader Abhishek Pal (Uttar Pradesh) with just 10m left to the beam and used his long strides to break the favourite’s will over the last couple of meters. Considering that it was only his first 1500m race at the national level after doing well in the 800m, Krishna Kumar was impressive in his victory. 

DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) produced a classy men’s Javelin Throw contest, slinging five throws over the 80m mark between them. Manu had the two best throws of the evening and won the crown with a best effort of 84.33m. Shivpal Singh (Uttar Pradesh) marked his returned to competition with a best effort of 79.70m on his second try.

Archana Suseendran beats Hima Das in 100m to claim sprint double in Indian GP2 ,"March 27, 2023","AFI Media

Thiruvananthapuram, March 27: Tamil Nadu’s Archana Suseendran beat Hima Das in the 100m final and made the most of the Assam sprinter’s disqualification in the 200m to claim a double and steal the thunder in the women’s events in the AFI Indian Grand Prix 2 at the Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education here today.

The 24-year-old Ajmal clocked his second sub-47 second time this season, improving on the 46.90 seconds he won the AFI National 400m Championships title in here earlier this month. Despite winning the National Games crown in 46.29 seconds last year, he was only fifth best Indian last year and will be looking to establish himself as the leading quarter miler in the Asian Games year.

With a best of 19.76m, the left-handed Tajinderpal Singh Toor dominated the men’s Shot Put. Each of his four valid efforts were better than the 19.17m that his Punjab team-mate Karanveer Singh managed to edge out Sahib Singh (Delhi) to claim the second place.

Long Jumper Shaili Singh and Ragul Kumar lend touch of class on final day,"October 19, 2022","Bengaluru, Oct 19: Shaili Singh came up with a season’s best effort of 6.41m on her last attempt to win the women’s Long Jump title on maiden appearance in the 61st AFI National Open Athletics Championships at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here today. Her final jump, her second longest leap ever, provided a golden touch to the final day’s proceedings.

The 18-year-old was assured of gold even before that leap. Her opening effort of 6.25m was better than the 6.22m that Kerala jumper Sruthi Lekshmi and Nayana James managed across their six tries each. The Railways trio finished outside the medal bracket, with V Neena barely missing the podium with a best of 6.21m.

In the men’s 200m, Tamil Nadu’s Ragul Kumar experienced a sub-21 second sprint for the first time as he won in 20.87 seconds, the third fastest time by an Indian this year behind the 20.52 and 20.55 clocked by Amlan Borgohain in the Federation Cup in April and the National Games earlier this month.

Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Services), whose performance was worth 1162 points, and 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji (Railways), whose sub-13 second effort was worth 1174 points, claimed the Best Athlete titles for men and women respectively.

Railways won the overall team championships with 297 points while Services and host Karnataka were second and third with 174 points and 69.50 points respectively. Services, which scored all its points in the men’s events, beat Railways to the men’s title. The Railways women collected a whopping 201 points to leave Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh far behind.

On the final day of the five-day meet, Gujarat’s Murli Kumar Gavit won the men’s 10,000m, his first National crown in four years since claiming the distance double in Bhubaneswar in September 2018. Akita Dhyani (Railways) made her maiden 10,000m race at the National level a memorable one by winning it in 34:39.05, comfortably from her competitors.

The 35km Race Walk events produced meet records for Ram Baboo (Uttar Pradesh) and Payal (Uttarakhand). Ram Baboo improved his own mark by more than 7 minutes by winning in 2 hours 29 minutes and 5 seconds. Payal beat the record holder Ramandeep Kaur and her mark set last year by more than 10 minutes in winning in 3 hours 4 minutes 48 seconds.

Hammer Thrower KM Rachna (Uttar Pradesh) marked her returned to competition with three efforts over 60m, including a personal best of 63.66m, to beat National Record holder Sarita Romit Singh. With a couple of hearty efforts in the end, Sarita Singh sent the ball and chain over 59.85m and 59.96m to edge out Tanya Chaudhary in the race to second place.

Aishwarya’s leap puts Tajinderpal Toor and Annu Rani’s efforts in the shade,"June 12, 2022","AFI Media

Chennai, June 12: Karnataka Long Jumper B Aishwarya’s explosive effort in the qualifying round put solid efforts by Shot Putter Tajinderpal Singh Toor (Punjab) and Javelin Thrower Annu Rani in the shade on the third day of the SNJ 61st National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday.

Aishwarya produced a stunning 6.73m leap in the women’s Long Jump qualifying round for a new Meet Record. Other familiar names like Ancy Sojan and Nayana James (both Kerala) and World U20 silver medalist Shaili Singh (Uttar Pradesh) also made it. to the final without fuss.

The 24-year-old Aishwarya’s effort pitchforked her to the second place on the Indian all-time list behind Anju Bobby George who set the National Record at 6.83m in the Athens Olympics in 2004 and backed it with a 6.75m effort to win the World Athletics Final in 2005. She took over the meet record from Mayookha Johny, who had pegged it at 6.63m in 2011.

Tajinderpal Singh Toor’s search for 20m puts ended on Sunday evening when he was able to send the iron ball past that mark three times. Despite registering no marks on two visits to the circle, the 27-year-old Olympian came up with three efforts over 20.14m, 20.29m and 20.34m to fine form and run out an easy winner.

Uttar Pradesh’s Annu Rani, India’s only woman Javelin thrower in the 60m club, had only two legal throws on Sunday but the second of those was over 60.93m. She has thrown the spear farther twice this season, but she will be happy that she has regained the consistency that she had embraced in the rup up to the Olympic Games last year.

There was a shock in store for Andhra Pradesh’s 100m Hurdler Jyothi Yarraji, who made waves with a series of good races overseas during which she took ownership of the National Record with a 13.04-second effort in the Netherlands. She did not find the rhythm, knocking a couple of hurdles down and tumbling on to the track after crashing into the final hurdle.

Tamil Nadu’s C Kanimozhi won the event in 13.62 seconds, becoming the second fastest Indian in the event this year. Jyothi Yarraji has the top six times and Kanimozhi improved her season’s best from 14.07 seconds to rise to the second spot behind the National Record holder and above the likes of Nandini Agasara (Telangana) and Aparna Roy (Kerala).

Himachal Pradesh’s Ankesh Chaudhary (1:50.02), Haryana’s Krishan Kumar (1:51.19) and Kerala’s Mohammed Afsal (1:52.22) won their respective heats to make it to the men’s 800m final.

Yashvir’s dramatic entry to 80m Club steals Women Long Jumpers’ Thunder,"May 24, 2022","AFI Media

Bhubaneswar, May 24: It needed something special to take the focus away from the long jump pit in the Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics Competition at the Kalinga Stadium here on Tuesday night. And two young Javelin Throwers, Yashvir Singh (Rajasthan) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) delivered that performance by going past the 80m mark.

On a night when Nayana James produced two efforts over 6.37m to win the high-profile women’s Long Jump title from Ancy Sojan (6.35m) and World U20 Silver Medalist Shaili Singh (6.27m), Yashvir Singh wrested the spotlight with a winning effort of 82.13m. The 20-year-old thus became only the 12th Indian to send the spear over 80m.

The Rajasthan thrower became the third javelin thrower from the country after DP Manu (Karnataka) and Rohit Yadav (Uttar Pradesh) to join the 80m Club this year. Yashvir Singh, who missed the mark by a whisker in Patiala on March 17 last year, got his ahead of Rohit Yadav and Manu on Tuesday night to win gold.

The men’s Long Jump did not have as much drama as the women’s event since each of Muhammed Anees Yahiya’s four legal jumps on Tuesday night was good enough to fetch him gold. The Kerala jumper peaked with his two of his last three tries, crossing the 8.00m mark. The 8.15m effort on his fifth attempt was the best of the night.

From the home fans’ point of view, Amiya Kumar Mallick and Aryan Ekka’s 1-2 in the men’s 100m sprint as well as Srabani Nanda’s victory in the women’s 100m were pleasing. The two Odisha men drew from one another in the second of the four races. Srabani Nanda, running her first 100m in around a year, had to find her own pace to win in

Women’s Long Jump competition can feature Intense battle in IGP4,"May 23, 2022","AFI Media

Bhubaneswar, May 23: An intense women’s Long Jump contest may be the most engaging of battles in the Indian Grand Prix 4 Athletics Competition at the Kalinga Stadium on Tuesday. Besides the season leaders Ancy Sojan and Nayana James, the event will be spiced up by World Junior Championships silver medallist Shaili Singh’s return to competition after nine months.

Rohit Yadav and Sahil Silwal will resume their duels in men’s Javelin Throw while Parul Chaudhary will seek to assert her superiority over Komal Jagdale in 3000m Steeplechase and Navjeet Kaur Dhillon will want to post another victory over the experienced campaigned Seema Antil in the women’s Discus Throw but the Long Jump pit may draw the most attention.

Ancy Sojan, who leapt past the 6.50m mark twice in successive competitions in March, will aspire to showcase consistency and form. Nayana James won the Federation Cup in Kozhikode last month with a 6.47m leap. Sherin Abdul Gafoor will also seek a return to top form while Shaili Singh’s first competition since the World Junior Championships will be keenly watched.

Even though season leader’s M Sreeshankar and Jeswin Aldrin are not entered, a look at the men’s Long Jump entry list suggests that this competition will be just as intense. Muhammed Anees Yahiya, who cracked the 8.00m barrier last year and improved to 8.15m on March 1 this year, and Yugant Shekhar Singh can dish out rich fare for the fans.

There will be some stirring races on track. Jisna Mathew and Vithya Ramaraj will both want to show improved form in the women’s 400m. There are many aspirants in the men’s quarter-mile event while MP Jabir’s form in the 400m Hurdles will evoke interest. Odisha’s Srabani Nanda, running her first 100m since July 25, will be the one to watch in the women’s sprint.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/igp-4-article-750-420.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/womens-long-jump-competition-can-feature-intense-battle-in-igp4/,Athletics
Sreeshankar produces third best leap to steals the thunder with a dramatic victory,"March 1, 2022","AFI Media

 Thiruvananthapuram, 1 March 2022: M Sreeshankar marked his return to competition by holding his nerve to produce his third best jump ever, 8.17m, to record a dramatic victory in the men’s Long Jump in the inaugural AFI National Open Jumps Competition at the Chandrasekharan Nair Police Stadium here on Tuesday.

Sreeshankar’s opening leap of 8.14m appeared good enough to seal victory but Mohammad Anees Yahiya produced his personal best effort, 8.15m, on his last attempt to leave the Olympian with the task of passing that on his last try. The 22-year-old bettered that by 2cm with an explosive effort, ensuring that he now has three of the four best jumps by an Indian.

The two men’s long jumpers were among six athletes who went past the qualifying standards for the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games laid down by the Athletics Federation of India. Woman Long Jumper Ancy Sojan and three Triple Jumpers Eldhose Paul, Karthik Unnikrishnan and Abdulla Aboobacker were the others who shared the limelight.

Eldhose Paul and Karthik Unnikrishnan notched up personal bests of 16.93m and 16.87m with their last attempts. The 25-year-old Eldhose Paul, whose previous best of 16.62m was achieved in June last, found the rhythm to wrest the lead back from Karthik, who improved his personal best from 16.80m, to bring the Triple Jump competition to a heady climax.

Ancy Sojan got her personal best of 6.51m on her fifth try to become only the eighth Indian woman long jumper to pass the 6.50m mark. Each of her five valid jumps were past the 6.20m. Nayana James also had similar consistency with her shortest jump measured at 6.18m as she offered her quality competition but could not do better than 6.35m.

Abhinaya Shetty got her personal best of 1.82m in the women’s High Jump but failed to clear the bar at 1.84m, the height that would have seen her meet the Asian Games qualifying standard. Gracena Merly, the only Indian woman who has leapt over that height in the past four years, was unable to clear 1.80m on Tuesday.

The day closed with another dramatic last-ditch effort to secure a win, this time by Aleena Jose to edge out V Sheena in women’s Triple Jump. Sheena led from the start, having opened with a 12.45m effort and bettering that with 12.47m in the fourth attempt. Aleena Jose, lying third in the triangular contest, catapulted to the top with a 12.68m effort in the sixth and final try.

"Nithin, Alex Antony confirm their rise as New Faces on Indian Track","August 28, 2019","AFI Media

Lucknow, August 28: BalakumarNithin and Alex Antony confirmed that they would be new faces on the national athletics firmament as they won the men’s 200m and 400m finals respectively in great style in the 59th National Inter-State Athletics Championships at the PAC Stadium here on Wednesday.

 

Having won the sprint double in the Khelo India Youth Games in Pune earlier this year, Nithin’s winning time of 20.91 seconds here was the third-best on the list among Indians over the 200m this year. Only Arokia Rajiv and Muhammed Anas Yahiya, 400m specialists, have run faster than the bespectacled sprinter from Tamil Nadu.

 

Alex Antony, who first gave notice of his potential with a 46.66-second run in the Indian Grand Prix V in Patiala earlier this month upon return to the track after three years, improved his personal best with a 46.17-second effort. It is creditable that he won a race that included runners of the caliber of AyyasamyDharun and Tamilarasan Santhosh.

 

The pair finished fifth and seventh while Haryana’s Harsh Baljeet Singh and Sachin Roby (Karnataka) took the lesser medals but finishing inside 47 seconds each. Kunhu Mohammed, who has been part of the Indian relay team, was unable to go past the semifinals run in the morning, clocking 47.69 in finishing third in his heats.

 

Triple jumper Arpinder Singh sought gamely to overcome the sapping humidity – he said he consumed two litres of fluids during the competition – but managed a best of 16.83m, 12cm short of the World Championship qualifying standard. In an intense competition, he was pushed close by Karnataka’s U Karthik and Tamil Nadu’s Mohammed Salahuddin.

 

Chithra’s 2:02.96, easily her personal best time in the two-lapper, was comparable to the 2:02.70 clocked by M Gomathi in finishing first in the Asian Athletics Championships. In Manjit Singh and Jinson Johnson’s absence, Mohammed Afsal did not let the scorching heat and humidity get to him as he produced the year’s best by an Indian in the 800m, clocking 1:48.35.

 

The results (all finals):

Sreeshankar’s 8m leap enlivens Indian Grand Prix V in Patiala,"August 16, 2019","AFI Media

Patiala, August 16: Long jumper M Sreeshankar marked his return to competition on Indian soil after six months with a season’s best leap of 8.00m that gave the Indian track and field fans reason for cheer at the Indian Grand Prix V at the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports here today. He had last competed in India at Sangrur on March 2 and had touched 7.97m in Bishkek last month.

On a very humid evening, Sreeshankar was all pumped up over his first three jumps, hitting soil at 7.95m twice after touching down at 8.00m with his first jump. An uncharacteristic 6.71m was followed by 7.62 and 7.73m efforts. Barring that fourth leap, each of his jumps was farther than his competitors managed today.  

 

The 8.00m effort was only the third time in his nascent career that Sreeshankar leapt over eight metres or more, having jumped 8.11m and 8.20m in the National Open Championships in Bhubaneshwar to wrest the National record from Ankit Sharma. A heel injury kept the 20-year-old away from the track largely until June when he went to Europe for four competitions.

 

“I have not competed much after coming back from injury. I am happy to hit 8-meter mark again but I need to improve it further,” said Sreeshankar after the competition.

 

Karnataka’s Siddharth Naik was second with 7.56m, edging out Haryana’s Sahil Mahabali by a mere centimeter.

 

Shot putter Inderjeet Singh looked determined to go past the 20m mark – the World Championship qualifying is pegged at 20.70m – when he opened with a season’s best 19.51m. Yet, despite a good string of four throws in excess of 19m, his opening effort remained his best He fouled his last two attempts and will have to quality at the National Inter-State Championships later this month.

 

Archana Suseentran (Tamil Nadu) gave the 200m sprint her best and won the two-woman race in a career best time of 23.18 seconds but could not meet the World Championship qualification standard (23.02 seconds). Having finished second behind Dutee Chand in the 100m, she returned to the track determined to make the half-lapper one to remember.

 

With Hina getting left behind quite early in the race, the 25-year-old Archana had to focus on racing against the clock. The result was a dramatic improvement in her personal best from 24.03 seconds in January 2017 to 23.18 seconds.

 

Her last 200m sprint at the National level was in the National Open in Chennai on September 28, 2017. Last year, she took part in one race over the distance in the Tamil Nadu State Championship but spent much time focusing on the short sprint so that she could be part of the Indian 4x100m relay team in the Asian Athletics Championships in Doha earlier this year.

In the men’s 400m hurdles, Vijay Singh Mallik (Services) breached the 51-second barrier for only the second time in his career, clocking 50.99 seconds as he finished second behind Tamilarasan Santhosh Kumar (Tamil Nadu) by four-hundredths of a second and ahead of the seasoned Jithin Paul (Kerala).

 

The 26-year-old Malik, who had clocked a personal best of 50.15 seconds in the Services Championships in September last year, has been training in Patiala while the sub-50-second hurdlers, Santhosh Kumar, 21, and Jithin Paul, 29, have been based in Spala, Poland for some time now.

Patiala. Arpinder Singh, Asian Games gold medallist and the first Indian to win a medal at the IAAF Inter-continental Cup, will be the leading contender in the Men’s Triple Jump heats at the 23rd Federation Cup Senior National Athletics Championships to be held at the National Institute of Sport, Patiala from March 15-18, 2019.

Neena Pinto will start the favorite in the women’s Long Jump section. The Asian Games silver medallist will be joined by last year’s Fed Cup gold medallist Nayana James.

In the absence of Asian and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Neeraj Chopra, the Javelin throw men’s category is set for an interesting four-way battle. Sahil Silwal, Vipin Kassana, Shivpal Singh and the returning Davinder Singh Kang should make it an event worth following. In the women’s section, national record holder Annu Rani will be the overwhelming pick for the gold medal.

Reigning Asian champion Swapna Barman will be in action in the Heptathlon. The 22-year-old from Jalpaiguri is expected to break the 6000-point barrier once again but Odisha’s Purnima Hembram is expected to push Barman all the way.

The men’s High Jump field will be a depleted one in the absence of last year’s gold and silver medallists. NCAA champion and NR holder Tejaswin Shankar is absent, as is the 2018 Fed Cup silver medallist Siddharth Yadav. Balasubramanya Chethan, who represented India at the Asian Games in Jakarta, will be the athlete to watch out for in this section.

In the Hammer Throw competition, junior National Record holder Ashish Jakhar is expected to bring home the gold medal.

S Siva, the national record holder in Pole Vault, will be back to defend his crown in Patiala. The 22-year-old set his previous record of 5.15 metres last year in Patiala.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/16-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/federation-cup-athletics-begins-on-friday-in-patiala/,Athletics

"Seema wins fourth CWG medal, Navjeet bags bronze","April 12, 2018","AFI Media
12 April 2018

Gold Coast (Australia). India athletes opened their account at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games 2018 winning two medals in the women’s discus throw competition. Competing at Gold Coast’s Carrara Stadium,  Seema Antil Punia and Navjeet Dhillon won the silver and bronze medals respectively with throws of 60.41m and 57.43m.

Punia’s silver was her fourth consecutive medal at the Commonwealth Games. She had earlier won a silver at the 2006 edition in Melbourne, a bronze at the 2010 Games in Delhi, a silver at the Glasgow Games before her podium finish at Gold Coast. Punia, 34, threw the discus to the silver medal winning distance in her very first throw of the competition.

She failed to improve on that first effort of 60.41m. Punia recorded throws of 59.57m in her second attempt, a foul throw in her third, an effort of 58.54m in her fourth followed by another foul and a final effort of 58.90m. It was short of her seasons best of 61.05m recorded at the Federation Cup last month and of her personal best of 64.84m recorded 14 years back in Kiev. Neither of those efforts would be enough overcome Australia’s Dani Stevens who flung the discus a massive 68.26m for a new Games Record.

While Punia won her fourth medal, Navjeet Kaur Dhillon won her first ever medal at the Commonwealth Games. It was a medal won right at the brink of defeat. As she stepped up to take her final throw of the competition, Dhillon was trailing in fourth place with a best throw  56.22m, nearly a meter short of New Zealand’s Sositina Hakeai who had thrown 57.16m. Dhillon though managed to record a throw of 57.43m with her very final attempt to pip the Kiwi. It was the biggest senior international medal won by Dhillon, who four years earlier had joined Punia as one of only two Indian women to have won a World junior medal.

There was disappointment in store for the other two Indian women competing for a medal at Gold Coast. Long jumpers Nayana James and V Neena had poor days finishing 12th and 10th in the field of 12 athletes in the final. James, who had a personal best of 6.55m could only record a best jump of 6.14m in her three attempts. The effort would have been particularly disappointing for James had recorded a jump of 6.34m simply to qualify for the final a couple of days ago. It was a similar story for Neena also. The athlete had a personal best jump of 6.66m but could only clear 6.19 on Thursday. That jump too was short of her effort of 6.24m to qualify for the final.

CK Valson, Secretary AFI, said from Gold Coast, “We are extremely pleased with Seema and Navjeet’s performance today. We expected a medal in Women’s discus throw and we got two. We are also very happy with the results of Mohammed Anas and Hima Das in 400m events,”

“However, results were not satisfactory in Women’s long jump event. Both athletes (Nayana James and Neena Verakil) were expected to do better. There are still few events left such as Men’s Javelin Throw and Triple Jump in which we can expect a medal each,” said Valson.

The day however ended with the promise of better fortunes on Friday. After Four events on Thursday, Heptathlete Purnima Hembram was in sixth place with 3441 points. Purnima Hembram recorded a recorded a  time of 13.56m in the 110m hurdles for 1041 points, jumped a height of 1.72m in the high jump for another 879 points, threw the shot put 11.75m for 645 points before then clocked 25.12 seconds in the 200m for 876 points. With three events remaining – long jump, javelin throw and the 800m – Hembram will be hopeful of climbing up from her position and even perhaps recording a personal best.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Seema-wins-fourth-CWG-medal-Navjeet-bags-bronze.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/seema-wins-fourth-cwg-medal-navjeet-bags-bronze/,Athletics
Hima finishes sixth with personal best timing at CWG final,"April 11, 2018","AFI Media
11 April 2018

Gold Coast. Hima Das showed no nerves in what was her first ever final at the Commonwealth Games, finishing sixth in the women’s 400m with a creditable time of 51.32seconds. 18-year-old Das, who had only began undertaking formal coaching about a year ago and only started running the 400m a few months back, performed impressively on the biggest stage of her career. Das in fact finished with an identical time as the fifth place finisher Maximila Imali but placed behind in the photo finish.

What was particularly impressive about Das was that she has showed consistent improvement over her short career. She had run the semifinal heat with a time of 51.53 seconds which lasted as her personal best for a little less than a day. On the day of the final, Das was running in the first lane of what was a world level field and stayed close to the chasing pack after former world champion Amantle Montsho had taken the early lead. Montsho’s gold was never in question as she clocked a time of 50.15 seconds with Anastasia Leroy taking second with a time of 50.57 seconds. Stephanie McPherson took third with 50.93 seconds. However Das stayed within touching distance of fourth place Christine BotLogetswe who finished just .15 seconds ahead of her with a time of 51.17 seconds.

While the medal might have been out of reach, Das certainly showed she will be a force to watch out for in the coming years.

Das was not the only young Indian in the final. Tejaswin Shankar had qualified for the final of the men’s high jump where he finished after clearing a height of 2.24m. Shankar who started strongly, clearing 2.18m with his very first jump, cleared heights of 2.21 and was one of seven jumpers who managed to clear 2.24m. However the height of 2.27m would prove too much for him on the day. Shankar, a 19-year-old college student at Kansas State University, had a personal best of 2.28m, recorded twice this year but fell just short of that at the Carrara stadium.

The gold in the event was won by Australia’s Brandon Starc, younger brother of Australian cricketer Mitchell Starc, who cleared a personal best of 2.32m while silver and bronze went to Jamal Wilson and Django Lovett who both cleared 2.30m with Wilson winning by virtue of clearing that height in fewer attempts.

Earlier in the day, two Indian athletes also managed to qualify for the final of the women’s long jump competition. Nayana James and V Neena managed to advance from the qualifying rounds after only four contestants managed to clear the automatic qualifying standard of 6.60m.

Run Adam Federation Cup 2018 kick starts tomorrow in Patiala,"March 4, 2018","AFI Media
04 March 2018

Patiala. The chance to grab a spot in the Indian athletics squad for the Commonwealth Games will be up for grabs at the four-day long Run Adam 22nd Federation Cup meet that begins at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on 5th March. India has been permitted to send a 37-member squad for the quadrennial event, of which for the moment only the names of four Indian racewalkers have been announced. The Federation Cup will serve as the final chance to qualify for a majority of athletes in the country. Indeed even the performance of athletes who have already met the AFI qualifying guidelines will be taken into consideration before the final squad is announced.

Chopra, has cemented his claim as the country’s premier javelin thrower is coming off a gold medal at the Indian Grand Prix with an impressive 82.88m throw. This was the season’s second competition where Chopra has crossed 80m. Recently, he claimed silver with a throw of 82.80m at an international throws event in Offenburg, Germany.

Tejaswin Shankar, scaled new height in the men’s high jump by clearing 2.28m at the Big 12 Indoor Championships in Iowa. Shankar who is on an athletics scholarship at Kansas State University, had already shattered the indoor national record with a jump of 2.19m earlier this year. Nayana James, a silver medallist at the Asian Indoor Championships in January, is also in fine form having managed a jump of 6.47m at the Indian Grand Prix.

In the Women’s discus throw, Seema Punia, who is competing in her first discus competition of the season, didn’t have a great 2017, with a best throw of 54.14m however with her sights set on qualifying for the Commonwealth Games, she would be itching to get close to her personal best of 64.84m.

In the men’s shot put event, Tajinder Pal Toor, would be looking to improve on his effort at the Indian Grand Prix. Toor, had heaved the iron sphere a distance of 19.95m, some 25cm shy of the qualification standard of 20.20m. However, with a personal best of 20.40m set in Patiala, Toor, who won a silver at the Asian Indoor Championships will be confident of making a strong bid for the qualification mark.

The championships will kick-off with Women’s long jump qualifying event in the morning while Men’s Pole Vault will be the first final of the competition in the evening session.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-5.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/run-adam-federation-cup-2018-kick-starts-tomorrow-in-patiala/,Athletics
Neeraj Chopra makes winning return at Indian Grand Prix,"February 27, 2018","AFI Media
27 February 2018

Patiala. Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra made a return to domestic competition with a strong performances to claim gold at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1. Chopra threw the spear a distance of 82.88m at the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday to finish ahead of Vipin Kasana who managed a best throw of 80.04m. Amit Kumar took bronze with a best of 77.33m. It was a much anticipated result for Chopra, who was taking part in his first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

Chopra was not the only athlete to impress though. Shot Putter Tajinder Pal Toor claimed gold in the men’s shot put with a best throw of 19.95m. While Tajinder has a personal best of 20.40m, recorded at the same venue in June last year, his throw on Tuesday was credible coming as early as it did in the season. Toor, improved on 19.77m he threw to claim a silver at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January this year. Toor finished ahead of Naveen Chikkara who threw the put 19.08m while the bronze went to Paramjeet Singh who only managed 16.74m.

Two athletes would also join Chopra in meeting the AFI qualifying guidelines for the Commonwealth Games. Long jumper Nayana James and women’s discus thrower Navjeet Dhillon also managed to meet the minimum requirement.

James, carried on from the form that saw her winning silver at the Asian Indoor Championships by claiming gold in Patiala with a best jump of 6.47m. She finished ahead of Nina Pinto who cleared 6.41m. Purnima Hembram also managed to step on the podium with a best effort of 5.99m.

Former World Junior bronze medalist Navjeet Dhillon too delivered a personal best effort of 59.18m to inch past the AFI qualifying guidelines of 59m.

Also coming close to the qualifying guideline was triple jumper Rakesh Babu. The Kerala jumper managed a best of 16.59m on Tuesday coming a centimeter short of the AFI standard of 16.60m. Babu’s effort however was good enough to win gold, edging Commonwealth bronze medalist Arpinder Singh who managed a best of 16.45m. National record holder Renjith Maheshwary finished third with a jump of 16.09m.

Amongst the other bright performers of the day were MP Jabir who claimed the 400m hurdles gold with a time of 50.60seconds, just shy of his personal best of 50.22m. Jabir finished ahead of Santhosh Kumar (50.85 seconds) and Binu Jose (52.77seconds). Upcoming triple jumper Renu produced a mini upset on the day. Renu jump of 13.26m was enough to pip the 13.08m effort of NV Sheena, a silver medalist at last months Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran. 18-year-old Hima Das too gave a strong account of herself with a personal best timing of 11.74 seconds in the women’s 100m race. Das took silver behind gold medalist Dutee Chand who clocked 11.57 seconds.

RUN ADAM IGP PREVIEW,"February 26, 2018","Athletics season starts with Run Adam IGP in Patiala on Tuesday

AFI Media
26 February 2018

Patiala: Javelin throw national record holder Neeraj Chopra will be the star performer in action at the Run Adam Indian Grand Prix-1 (Run Adam IGP) to be held in the National Institute of Sport in Patiala on Tuesday. Chopra though will only be one of a total of 129 competitors for whom the prestigious one day event essentially marks the beginning of the Indian domestic calendar.

For the athletes, the eventual goal is to match the qualifying standards for the Commonwealth Games. While the Run Adam IGP will likely serve as a warm up event ahead of the Federation Cup in early March, the high quality of the field could well spring up a few surprises.

For Chopra the tournament will be a first competition since his return from Offenburg in Germany, where the 20-year-old had been training with Werner Daniels. After a three month stint, Chopra has since returned to the national camp in Patiala where he has resumed training with former world record holder Uwe Hohn.

While this is the first domestic tournament, several of the athletes are in strong form, having competed in prior international events. 100m sprinter Elakiya Dasan is fresh off a bronze medal at the Asian Indoor Championships in Tehran in January and subsequently another bronze at the Asian Games Test event in Jakarta. In the latter event he had clocked 10.31 seconds which is the fastest time run by an Indian outside India. He will be challenged by Amiya Mallick who holds the national record in the 100m of 10.26 seconds. Mallick, who has been training in the USA for the past one month has set his target as qualifying for the Commonwealth Games.

Other athletes to watch out for are long jumper Nayana James, who claimed a silver medal at the Asian Indoor Championships and a bronze at the Asian Championship, shot putter Tejinder Pal Toor who won a silver at Bhubaneshwar and national record holder and defending Asian quarter mile champion Mohammad Anas.

Amongst the youngsters to keep an eye on is 18-year-old Hima Das who clocked an impressive personal best of 23.59 seconds in the women’s 200m at the Asian Games. The time was the second fastest by a U-20 athlete this year. While Das will only be running in the 100m in Patiala, she would be keen to make a mark at that event too.

Due to fewer entries in women’s shot put and discus throw and men’s high jump, these events have been dropped from the competition.

"Devinder, Sonia win gold on opening day of Asian Games invitational tournament","February 11, 2018","Jakarta, Feb 11: India won two gold medals, three silver and as many bronzes on the opening day of athletics at the Asian Games invitational tournament in Jakarta on Sunday. While the purpose of the competition is to serve as a test event for the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium, Indian competitors put up a strong show ahead of what will be a busy season. Competing in his first competition of the season, javelin thrower Devinder Singh Kang, the bronze medalist at last year’s Asian Championships stamped Indian dominance in the event. Kang, a finalist at the 2017 World Championships, recorded a best effort of 75.87m to finish ahead of Ranasinghe Denagamage of Sri Lanka who had a best effort of 75.39m. 18-year-old Sachin Silwal added bronze for India with a best effort of 68.12m. Kang who recently began training under former world record holder Uwe Hohn, appeared out of touch initially and was trailing Denagamage until his final effort before producing a mark that put the gold medal out of reach of the Sri Lankan.

Sonia Baishya would add to India’s medal tally with a gold in the women’s 400m. Baishya, 22, would run the quarter mile in a time of 53.53seconds, to pip teammate Nithya Shree Ananda who clocked 54.34 seconds. It was a personal best for the West Bengal athlete beating her previous best by .45 seconds.
Jithu Baby added a silver to India’s kitty with a strong performance in the men’s 400m. Jithu, the reigning gold medalist at the Indian National Open Championships claimed gold with a time of 46.88 seconds to finish .05 seconds behind Pattiya Mullewaththe of Sri Lanka.

Another two medals were added by V Neena and Nayana James in the women’s long jump event. Neena, holder of the longest jump after Anju Bobby George, was nowhere near her best but still managed a leap of 6.42m. She finished ahead of compatriot James who cleared 6.16m in her final jump of the competition. The result mirrored the competition between the two at last month’s Asian Indoor Championships, where James, the reigning Asian Champion had claimed silver and Neena the bronze medal.

Competing in their first competition of the season, most Indian athletes appeared to be working their way into form. The exception though would be Elakiyadasan Kannadasan. The Tamil Nadu sprinter had the worst possible start, with the slowest reaction time (.152 seconds) and the disadvantage of running in the outermost lane. Despite this, Elakkiya Dasan clocked a credible personal best of 10.38 seconds to claim a bronze medal in the 100m in just his first outdoor competition of the season. Elakiyadasan has been in impressive start to the year. Running in the Asian Indoor championships in Tehran in January, Elakkiyadasan had claimed bronze. With the season only warming up, the 22-year-old would be expecting to push himself even further with hopes of qualifying for the Commonwealth Games.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/9-3.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/devinder-sonia-win-gold-on-opening-day-of-asian-games-invitational-tournament/,Athletics

Earlier in the morning session, Punjab’s Karamjit Kaur won her first Federation Cup title in the women’s 20km walk with a time of 1:40:01.68seconds. Soumya B of Delhi and Rani Yadav of Uttar Pradesh won silver and bronze with a time of 1:41:03.16 seconds and 1:42:22.32seconds. Karamjit thus joined her sister and national record holder Khushbir Kaur who has previously won the Federation Cup title. “I am satisfied with my result. This is my personal best effort,” said Karamjit. National coach Alexander Artsyabashev was also satisfied with the result despite it being nearly three minutes off the meet mark held by Khushbir Kaur in 2012. “This is a good result considering the temperature and the fact this this is our developmental squad. Our main team is currently training at the high-altitude center in Dharamsala with the target of performing at the World Championships in London,” said Alexander Artsyabashev.",Nayana James,https://indianathletics.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5-1.jpg,https://indianathletics.in/federation-cup-2017-neeraj-chopra-smashes-meet-record/,Athletics
