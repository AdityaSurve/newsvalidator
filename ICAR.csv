Today, the priority is to tackle and solve the challenges before agriculture. In this regard, he mentioned the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, under which Rs 1.22 lakh crore has been given to farmers as compensation for the loss of their crops. Shri Tomar said that all the farmers should be brought under the ambit of this scheme. This will especially make small farmers feel secure. He said that the productivity of the soil is decreasing due to the use of chemical fertilizers, hence organic and natural farming is being promoted. Prime Minister Shri Modi's emphasis is also on natural farming. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the central government is taking forward the agriculture sector. It is also being expanded through Krishi Vigyan Kendras. State governments also need to make more efforts in this direction.  The Minister expressed satisfaction on the success of Mustard Mission during first two years of its implementation.  Mustard production has jumped by 29% from 91.24 to 117.46 lakh tonnes in last two years.  The productivity saw 10% jump from 1331 to 1458 kg/ha. The area under rapeseed & mustard has increased by 17% from 68.56 in 2019-20 to 80.58 lakh ha in 2021-22. He appreciated the farming community and the State Governments for this commendable achievement. The increased mustard production will help in bridging the gap of imports of palm and sunflower oil. Government is now implementing Special Soybean and Sunflower Missions on the pattern of Mustard Mission. Shri Tomar said that the Central Government has started work on Digital Agriculture to bridge the gap between the farmers and the Government so that the farmers get the benefits of the government schemes transparently.

Effective Management of shoot gall psylla doubled the production of mango,-,"Amongst various insect-pests, shoot gall psylla, Apsylla cistellata Buckton (Psyllidae: Homoptera) is a devastating pest of mango causing formation of galls on the leaf axils which result in inhibition of inflorescence and most of the affected branches later dry up. According to an estimate, mango orchards in more than 4,000 ha area are badly affected with incidence of shoot gall psylla in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand. From last one decade, the incidence of shoot gall psylla has increased considerably in Dehradun. Earlier, monocrotophos, dimethoate and quilanphos insecticides  recommended for the control of shoot gall psylla these insecticides are not giving any relief to the farmers from the last 6-7 years, may be due to continuous use of these insecticides and change in agro environmental conditions.   Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Dehradun approached   ICAR-Central Institute of Sub Tropical Horticulture, Lucknow for effective management of shoot gall psylla in mango. The Institute suggested that thiamethoxam 1 g/liter of water + profenophos 2 ml/ liter of water + sticker 1 2 ml/ liter of water effectively manages of shoot gall psylla. Demonstrations conducted along with earlier recommended insecticides in which two spray of thiamethoxam 1 g/ liter of water + profenophos 2 ml/ liter of water have been reduced the incidence of shoot gall psylla up to 90 % in most affected orchard. Technology The insecticides i.e. thiamethoxam 1 g/ liter of water + profenophos 2 ml/ liter of water + sticker 1/ 2 ml/ liter of water have been found most promising in management of shoot gall psylla in mango. Two applications of both the insecticides were suggested, first spraying should be done in third week of August and second spraying be done 15 days after first spraying. The spraying of these insecticides by the farmers on the recommendation of KVK, Dehradun not only managed the incidence of shoot gall psylla but also doubled the productivity of mango.    Impact of technology Two Spraying of recommended insecticides were done by the farmers of Badwala village of Vikasnagar block of Dehradun in 21 ha area in August-September, 2013. Farmers harvested about 4000 Q. mango from 2100 trees in June-August, 2014. Two spraying of recommended insecticides have been applied by the farmers of 24 villages of Vikasnagar and Sahaspur blocks of Dehradun in about 200 ha area. The spraying of these insecticides significantly reduced the incidence of shoot gall psylla and increased the productivity of mango. According to an estimate and data recorded, farmers harvested about 40,000 Q. mango from 200 ha area in June-August, 2015. In the the last three years area has been increased from 21 ha in 2013 to 1,200 ha in 2015. According to an estimate and campaign organized in August, 2016 by KVK, Dehradun, it is expected that about more than 2,000 ha area will be covered under management of shoot gall psylla in 2016. The productivity of mango increased from 9.6 MT/ ha to 20.0 /per ha. The visible impact reflected due to technological intervention on management of shoot gall psylla at Badwala village on 2,100 mango trees during August-September, 2013 completely changed the mindset of neighbouring farmers. Effective management of shoot gall psylla in mango from 2013 to 2016 enhanced the income of farmers. Data recorded from the mango orchards and interaction held with the farmers revealed that about 6.0 crore additional income was earned by the farmers due to management of shoot gall psylla in mango from the last three years.

Participatory Fodder Production in Mango Orchards in Karnataka,-,"Shrinking farm size has consequence in apportioning it for perennial fodder cultivation by farmers. Non competitive land use for fodder production is hence inevitable to meet fodder deficiency situation. Karnataka is one of the important mango (Mangifera indica L.) producing states of the country. Inter row spaces in prime fruiting mango orchards provide opportunity for cultivation of perennial fodder crops. The common mango planting distance followed is 10 m by 10 m giving minimum 7-8 m inter space for introducing fodder crops. Karnataka has an estimated 90,000 ha in prime fruiting mango crop which if put under fodder crops is estimated to produce 39.5 lakh tons of green fodder in a year meeting more than seven lakh livestock’s green fodder requirement round the year.  This potential niche area was exploited successfully for introduction of improved high yielding fodder crops through participatory mode. The process started with pilot activity in 2013-14 covering only five mango growers in an area of five acres. The reassuring response received was en-cashed by scaling up in 2014-15 by linking with livestock based voluntary organizations to shorten rapport building time, series of field oriented trainings to farmers enabling them to select fodder species as per their resource matrix, providing seeds and planting materials, reconnaissance and data collection on diverse parameters including farmer to farmer spread of these crops. In second year 25 mango growers of 11 villages of Karnataka cultivated fodder crops in inter spaces of mango orchards covering an area of 25.05 acres.  Three perennial grasses (Bajra Napier hybrid-BNH, Guinea-G, Perennial fodder sorghum-PS) intercropped with fodder cowpea (CP) were cultivated by 32% mango growers, two grasses (BNH+G) by 28%, BNH alone by 12% and  8% each two grasses (BNH+PS) or one grass and one legume (BNH+CP, PS+CP) and 4% cultivated two grasses intercropped with fodder cowpea.                             During the project period, intra-farmer spread of area under fodder crops in interspaces was 17 % by 24% participating farmers. The area under fodder crops was thus increased by 45% thus increasing total area under fodder crops to 36.4 acres from initial 25.05 acres. With the 5 acres in the initial pilot period, the total area brought under fodder crops in mango orchard stands at 41.4 acres. Participating farmers reported many benefits on themselves, on their livestock rearing and on mango orchard per se. On livestock rearing, decrease in feed cost (88%) and improvement in livestock health (84%) by feeding improved fodder was reported. It helped them to decrease feed cost by 44.20% and increased average milk yield by 0.93 litres saving 1.37 km of daily distance treading to collect fodder and one manday every day for the same purpose.   Reduction in orchard temperature (100%), weed intensity (92%), soil erosion (88%), pest (68%) and disease (64%) occurrence and improvement in water penetration (84%) were the benefits reported on mango orchard. Earlier, the participating farmers were experiencing shortage of about 22% green fodder and 17% dry fodder. The project interventions helped them not only to effectively mitigate this fodder shortage but surplus production was observed with many farmers. The average green fodder production obtained was 55.49 tons/ha across 2.7 cuts.

Technological Interventions Ensured Tribals’ Livelihood in mango orchards,-,"A significant proportion of tribals have been engaged in shifting cultivation, especially on high lands without soil conservation measures with a high level of soil erosion, in Kashipur block of Rayagada district of Odisha. The place is located in the interior of forest at 500 km away from the state capital, Bhubaneswar. This practice was leading to the loss of land productivity, soil fertility and decrease in carrying capacity of the available natural resources. These lands are best suited for tree based perennial horticultural crops, such as mango having commercial potential in the area. Though the State Government has been making efforts since long, but somehow the tribals could not realize the commercial value of the mango.  Lack of result demonstration, pest incidence in some of the existing orchards and absence of assured mango marketing channel were the key constraints in the way of mango cultivation. Central Horticultural Experiment Station of Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, with the aim to enhance the livelihood of rtibals, started work in the area with the help of some of the nontribal farmers having mango orchards. These farmers served as risk bearer, technology demonstrator and a link between tribals and research station. In existing orchards, nutrient management, fruit fly management, Hot Water Treatment (HWT), fruit packing and transportation, pre and post harvest interventions for healthy fruits were demonstrated. Meanwhile, the market channel was established to a distance of 500 km. This brought the confidence among tribals which paved the way for significant increase in mango acerage in the tribal villages. The motivated households were supported with technological interventions such as planting material supply, planting technology, soil management in sloppy land and social mobilization through village meetings. Mango farmers organized themselves under a society ‘Horticulture and Agriculture Related Panchayats Association for Livelihood’ (HARPAL). The neighborhood effect in tribal villages motivated 550 households for mango planting in 27 hamlets of eight Gram Panchayats, namely Kashipur, Sulgunja, Sunger, Taljhari, Chandragiri, Shankara, Kudipari and Manusgaon on an area of 1150 acres under high density mode (5 X 5 m) on unused foot hills, gentle hillocks and sloppy land. Interventions have reduced the soil erosion from high lands and significant fall in the tradition of shifting cultivation due to availability of alternative source of livelihood. Many orchards planted during the period have started fruiting and families are realizing handsome monetary benefit. The work done in the area has been acknowledged by the State Government of Odisha also.   Most of the present plantations have been done on sloppy land, the in situ soil and water conservation practices have been followed. Generally orchard soils are poor and have disadvantageous location, hence attempts have been made to introduce IIHR mango special in the area. All the fields are having high density plantation which need perfect canopy management strategies and area is prone to hoppers, stone weevil, fruit borer and fruit flies, hence, management techniques are being demonstrated and adopted. However, looking to the production volume, more number of hot water treatment plants are required. Developing facilities for collection and packaging infrastructure and developing new marketing channels outside the state especially in south India is being explored. The results indicated that technological interventions through result demonstrations, social mobilization and development of marketing channel inculcated confidence among tribals for mango enterprise. The multiplying impact of the success would be visible more apparently in near future, however, further technological backup is needed for converting this tribal area into a mango belt. The area has now been selected for implementation of tribal sub-plan by the CHES-IIHR.

‘Chinta Mango’ farmer’s variety registered in PPVFRA,14th May 2024,"ICAR-Central Island Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair, Andaman & Nicobar Islands facilitated Shri. Chintaharan Biswas, a progressive mango farmer with 100 mango trees from Shaheed Dweep and supported him in registering his farmer variety, 'Chinta Mango,' with the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority, New Delhi.      Chinta Mango is the first mango variety registered under the PPVFRA. Dr. Himanshu Pathak, Secretary (DARE) & Director General (ICAR), presented the certificate to Shri. Biswas during his recent visit to ICAR-CIARI, Port Blair. The Mango variety belongs to the species Mangifera indica, a cultivated mango species. The special feature of this genotype is the characteristic purple color in the peel at the unripened stage. ICAR-CIARI has made efforts for the morphological and biochemical characterization of this genotype. Fruits are large, and the individual fruit weight ranges from 300-400g. The fruits are delicious with yellow pulp, sweet with less fibre content and the average TSS recorded is 19.6oB. Another unique feature of this genotype is the occurrence of polyembryonic seedlings. This is an additional advantage of this mango as the purity of the genotype can be maintained by seed propagation. The phytochemical characterization of fruit pulp showed its richness in carotenoids, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity. The registration process was facilitated under the supervision of Dr. Eaknath B. Chakurkar, Director, ICAR-CIARI, Port Blair.

Rust Proofing Wheat Production - A Mega Study Finds Novel Sources of Disease Resistance in Wheat Germ-plasm,-," Ever since Green Revolution, India has never seen back in food grain production, thanks to the continuous efforts of agriculture scientists in crop improvement including making the new varieties more resistant to different diseases. One significant constraint to increased wheat production is the variety of rust diseases attacking this crop— leaf rust, stem rust and stripe rust. Sources of resistance to these diseases are known, and have been utilised by wheat breeders for a long time. However, achieving durable resistance can be difficult, and the rust diseases continue to evolve and circumvent the breeders' achievements. Rust is spreading in different wheat growing regions in recent past and The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Rome issued alerts about the three diseases on 3 February 2017. Rust returned to Europe with a big outbreak in Sicily in 2016, even the hardy durum wheat, used to make pasta, was found to be susceptible to it.   Scientists from ICAR in collaboration with agricultural universities have created a history by evaluating the entire wheat germplasm collection (~20,000 accessions) conserved in the Indian National Genebank at ICAR-National Bureaux of plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi. The findings of the study authored by 37 contributors have been published in ‘PLOS ONE’ http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0167702). The results are of great practical significance keeping in view the continuous search of genes for breeding multiple rusts resistant wheat varieties. This is the first such well thought of experiment conducted ever on genebank collections of this magnitude.   Earlier, the entire wheat germplasm was characterised at a single site (2011-12) and core developed (DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-55675-6_4). This unprecedented initiative found an entry into Limca Book of Records in 2013.  The present study on evaluation discovered novel wheat germplasm resources carrying genes for resistance to all rusts and spot blotch diseases. 19,460 wheat accessions comprising three species of wheat - Triticum aestivum, T. durum and T. dicoccum and collected from within and outside the country were screened during the 2011-14 crop seasons sequentially at multiple disease hotspots, viz. Wellington (Tamil Nadu) for wheat rusts, Gurdaspur (Punjab) for stripe rust and Cooch Behar (West Bengal) for spot blotch. This led to shortlisting of potentially resistant accessions to multiple rusts (498 accs.) and spot blotch (868 accs.). Testing of the selected accessions for seedling resistance against seven virulent pathotypes (collected since 1930) of three wheat rusts under artificial epiphytotic conditions at Flowerdale, Shimla led to the identification of 137 accessions potentially resistant to multiple rusts. Molecular analysis added further value to the study and helped identify different combinations of genetic loci imparting resistance to leaf rust, stem rust, stripe rust and spot blotch. The resistant germplasm accessions, particularly against stripe rust, identified in this study can act as potential resources for integrating multiple disease resistance into the genetic background of high yielding wheat cultivars through conventional or molecular breeding approaches, thus ensuring food security at national and global levels. The study was funded by NICRA scheme of the ICAR. Another major scientific breakthrough of ICAR lead to the decoding of genomes of 15 strains of wheat rust fungus Puccinia triticina. It will aid in understanding the dynamic nature of this notorious wheat pathogen. The paper ""Draft genome of the wheat rust pathogen (Puccinia triticina)” published in  Genome Biology and Evolution unravels genome-wide structural variations during evolution     (http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/9/2702.full.pdf+html). The study found certain ""host spot regions"" in the genomes of Race 77 which are vulnerable for reshuffling, leading to variability in it providing an insight about P. triticina plant fungal pathogen, with emphasis on the genome structure, organization, molecular basis of variation and pathogenecity. This genome information will be an important landmark research in India and will facilitate wheat improvement programme in the country. Dedicated Research Centre for Wheat Rust The Indian Institute of wheat and Barley Research has a dedicated Center at Flowerdale (Shimla) to work on all aspects of wheat rust as its major mandate. The monitoring, timely forecasting and adoption of preventive strategies have kept India free from any major outbreak of wheat rust for last many decades. A mild loss of 5 percent by wheat rusts can cause yield reduction of 3.5 million tonnes in India. It equals approximately to loss of Rs. 3500 cores. The timely detection of new variants and the identification of resistant material, thereafter, have prevented any major loss to wheat. The strong and vibrant programme of monitoring wheat rust virulences has paid rich dividends to the nutritional and food security of the country.

Lr80 : A new and widely effective source of leaf rust resistance in wheat identified from India,-," landrace Hango-2, collected in 2006 from the Himalayan area of Hango, District Kinnaur, in Himachal Pradesh, exhibited a low infection type (IT;) at the seedling stage to all Indian P. triticina pathotypes, except the pathotype 5R9-7 which produced IT 3+. Pathotype 5R9-7(16-1) does not infect bread wheat cultivars, however, is virulent on tetraploid wheat Khapli. Pathotype 5R9-7 is not prevalent in nature for the last 15 years. Genetic analysis based on Agra Local/Hango-2-derived F3 families indicated monogenic control of leaf rust resistance, and the underlying locus was temporarily named LrH2. Bulked segregant analysis using 303 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers located LrH2 in the short arm of chromosome 2D. An additional set of 10 chromosome 2DS-specific markers showed polymorphism between the parents and these were mapped on the entire Agra Local/Hango-2 F3 population. LrH2 was flanked by markers cau96 (distally) and barc124 (proximally). The 90 K Infinium SNP array was used to identify SNP markers linked with LrH2. Markers KASP_17425 and KASP_17148 showed association with LrH2. Comparison of seedling leaf rust response data and marker locations across different maps demonstrated the uniqueness of LrH2 and it was formally named Lr80. This is the 5th rust resistance gene reported from India (others being Lr10, Lr48, Lr49, Lr57, and Lr58). Lr80, is being used to develop rust resistant genetic stocks and wheat varieties. It will help in creating diversity and management of leaf rust in India. The manuscript is appearing in Theoretical and Applied Genetic Research doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03735-5.

Develop Effective Roadmap to Usher Another Revolution in Wheat Production-Harish Rawat,-,"New Delhi, 02 September, 2011 ‘Wheat Production in some states of India has large gaps in potential and realized yields. Some of the gaps can be filled up through development of infrastructure facilities, while the production related barriers can be effectively overcome through adoption of appropriate interventions and technologies. Officials of different states must quickly transfer the technology available in the national system to minimize these gaps ’, said Sh. Harish Rawat, Minister of State for Agriculture, Food Processing Industries & Parliamentary Affairs. He was inaugurating 50th All India Wheat and Barley Research Workers’ Meet (September 1-4, 2011) jointly organized by the ICAR institutes, Directorate of Wheat Research, Karnal  and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. ‘World population is expected to reach more than 8 billion by 2030. In India, 95-100 million tones of wheat would be required to be produced to cover an estimated demand for 345 million tones of food grains in 2030. The need to produce more wheat has to be met with fewer resources in a sustainable and cost effective manner’, he added. He also urged agricultural scientists to work on expected onslaught of climate change so that challenges due to abiotic and biotic stresses can be addressed. ‘I am sure that this large group of wheat researchers from national and international systems gathered here will consider all the possible strategies to be faced by farmers across the country’, he said. Earlier, Dr S Ayyappan, Secretary, DARE and Director General, ICAR urged scientists to plan out the future for more wheat production.  He appreciated the multidisciplinary and multilocational coordinated trials and experiments that have enabled the country to harvest highest ever of 85.93 million tonnes of wheat during 2010-11. 
 Dr M V Rao, Former Special DG, ICAR discussed the different phases of wheat and barley improvement since green revolution. He stressed the importance of collaborative efforts between scientists and farmers for enhancing and maintaining food security in the country through technological interventions and policy support. Dr Indu Sharma, Project Director, DWR highlighted the leading role of DWR in national wheat and barley production systems. ‘This special event of golden jubilee meet will be utilized to have a free interaction and to develop strategies for enhancing productivity, quality and marketing prospects of wheat crop under changing climate condition’, she added. Dr Swapan K Dutta, Deputy Director General (Crop Scinece) and Dr H S Gupta, Director, IARI also graced the occasion. The Workshop which marks 50 years of most successful ever coordinated programme (All India Coordinated Wheat and Barley Improvement Project) in the country will deliberate on emerging issues and use the consensus among almost the entire wheat and barley fraternity to address these in a most effective manner.

Madhya Pradesh Transformed into Wheat Growing Hub,-,"The soy state is turning over a new leaf. Now Madhya Pradesh has earned a name for its high wheat production and quality. Farmers of Madhya Pradesh are moving towards scientific farming with the help of KVK. They have slowly scripted a new success story by producing the best wheat in India. Amongst many farmers of the state, one from the Malwa region of Ujjain district has belied all the previous notions. When it comes to taste, quality and other attributes, Madhya Pradesh's Sharbati tops the charts in demand in the metros. The lustrous, golden grain commands premium price. Being re-christened golden or premium wheat in wholesale and retail markets of Mumbai, Pune, Ahmadabad and Hyderabad or simply, MP wheat in major North Indian markets like Delhi.         Shri Yogendra Kaushik (61) resident of village Ajdawada district Ujjain (M.P.) completed his education in ICE (Mech.) during 1970- 71. Instead of searching job, he intrinsically adopted farming on 9.5 ha. land. He struggled to do something innovative and get rid of the traditional system of farming where he could just harvest Soybean, Chickpea, and Wheat, the productivity of which was slightly higher than the district average i.e., Soybean (JS-335) in Kharif and Gram (Dollar) and Wheat (Lok-1) in Rabi season. And the mean production of both crops was near about 15 q./ha and 50-52 q./ha respectively. But after 35 years of endurance he came into contact with KVK in 2005. Since then his thought, vision and approach towards scientific farming changed. After attending series of trainings and exposure visits he could achieve that goal for which he dreamt for almost four decades. This could be a valuable example for all the farmers in adopting the scientific technologies. Mr. Kaushik being a contract farmer was in touch with KVK Ujjain and hence, amongst the various seed based technologies assessed; the most promising for wheat crop was the variety HI-8663 (Poshan). KVK was instrumental in making available 50 kg breeder seed from IARI, Indore. The crop was sown in the month of November with full package of practices. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (RVSKVV) Ujjain (M.P.) was instrumental in providing 50 kg breeder seed of wheat (Variety- HI- 8663) which was sown in the 0.4 ha land. Crop cutting was done in the presence of revenue officials, Patwari, SADO, RAEO and other local villagers who witnessed the bumper production of wheat (HI-8663) recording 95.32 q/ha.   Recently, Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and several other studies indicate a probability of 10-40% loss in crop production in India and other countries of South Asia with increases in temperature by 2080-2100 and decrease in irrigation water. India could lose 4-5 million tons wheat production with every rise of 10 C temperature throughout the growing period even after considering carbon fertilization (but no adaptation benefits). HI 8663 (Poshan) is beneficial for farmers HI 8663 (Poshan) is a novel genotype characterized by excellent grain quality, high and stable yield. It can serve as a naturally bi-fortified food and can be used for ""dual purpose"", i.e., both for 'nutritive chapatti' and semolina, required for fast food preparation, because of its high β-carotene, high hectoliter weight, high SDS sedimentation value, higher protein content, high levels of micronutrients, lowest mottling (yellow berry incidence) and having better overall acceptability (7.0) for pasta. This variety was notified in May 2008 for cultivation under high fertility irrigated and timely sown conditions of Peninsular Zone. It is a widely adapted and high yielding variety, showing 1.4% to 28.4% yield superiority over checks MACS 2846, NIDW 295 and GW 1189. HI 8663 has shown good adaptation more number of tillers per sq. m, as compared to checks. It combines early maturity, tolerance to terminal heat stress. It ensures stability in wheat production and better yield even under deficient irrigation availability in Central Zone.     ",https://www.icar.org.in/node/2092,-,Wheat,Agriculture

"Genetic blueprint of bread wheat genome unveiled, last step before full genome sequence","11th May,  2022","18th July, 2014, New Delhi  Scientists from ICAR’s National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology (NRCPB), New Delhi, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, and Delhi University South Campus (DU) in collaboration with International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) have published a chromosome based draft sequence of the bread wheat genome in top international journal Science (18 July 2014) .  This is a pride moment for the country to be part of the international effort to decode one of the world’s most important food crops. India is entrusted with the responsibility of decoding wheat chromosome ‘2A’, which alone has a genomic DNA code of about 900 million base pairs (or letters) that is about two and a half times the size of whole rice genome, and about one third of the size of the human genome. The full wheat genome is about six times the size of human genome. The Indian initiative was financially supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India at a total cost of Rs 35 crores. Earlier, Indian scientists have helped crack the genetic code of rice and tomato as part of international consortia and also succeeded in decoding of pigeonpea (Arhar) and chickpea (Chana) genomes entirely on their own.    Wheat was considered as one of the hardest crop plants to decode due to its huge genome size of 17000 million base pairs, and presence of three sets of highly similar chromosomes in the genome. However, technological advances made in recent years and availability of specialized genetic stocks developed during 1950s in wheat variety ‘Chinese Spring’ made it possible to isolate individual wheat chromosomes for sequencing. The chromosome-based draft sequence provides new insight into the structure, organization and evolution of the large complex genome of the world’s most widely grown cereal crop. The decoding of wheat genome has identified more than 125,000 genes assigned to the individual wheat chromosomes. The draft sequence is a major landmark towards obtaining a complete reference sequence of the hexaploid bread wheat genome, the ultimate goal of the IWGSC. In the same issue of Science, another article presents the first reference sequence for the largest wheat chromosome, 3B. This establishes a proof of concept and a template for generating the reference sequence of all wheat chromosomes in the next three years.  With a chromosome-based full sequence in hand, wheat breeders will have high quality tools at their disposal to accelerate breeding programs and to identify how genes control complex traits such as yield, grain quality, disease and pest resistance and tolerance to drought, heat and salt stress. They will be able to produce superior wheat varieties at an accelerated pace to meet the demands of a growing world population in a changing environment.  The draft sequence is already providing new insights into the history and evolution of the wheat genome and genes involved in grain development and disease resistance. The goal of the IWGSC is to make a high quality genome sequence of bread wheat publicly available, in order to lay a foundation for basic research that will enable wheat breeders to fast track development of improved varieties. The genetic blueprint of wheat is an invaluable resource to plant science researchers and wheat breeders. For the first time, they have at their disposal a set of tools enabling them to rapidly and precisely locate specific genes on individual wheat chromosomes. In addition, it immediately provides thousands of markers for DNA fingerprinting, diversity analysis and marker-assisted breeding in wheat.  Anticipating the consequences of climate change, erratic rainfalls and global warming, ICAR has initiated major research projects on discovery of genes for tolerance to drought, heat and salt stress, resistance to devastating fungal diseases like wheat rusts, as well as bread and chapati making quality, but the progress has been slow due to non-availability of wheat genome sequence information. In the case of rice there has been a rapid progress in gene discovery and utilization during the last nine years after the publication of rice genome sequence in 2005. The availability wheat genome will now accelerate gene discovery efforts and fast track development of superior wheat varieties in a way similar to rice. Wheat is a major dietary component of human diet across the world. Cultivated on 215 million hectares, more land than any other crop, annual world wheat production is about 700 million tons, making it the third highest produced cereal grain after maize and rice. It is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having higher protein content than either maize or rice.

ICAR Signs Workplan Agreement with IRRI for Collaboration in Rice Research Genetic Enhancement of Rice Major Thrust Area,-,"June 22, 2005 New Delhi Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has signed a Work-plan Agreement (2005-2008) with International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila for collaboration in rice research. Both the organizations will cooperate in research areas of genetic resource conservation, evaluation, gene discovery, enhancing productivity and livelihood for fragile environments. Through this agreement, both the organizations will strengthen linkages between research and development, improvement and development of rain-fed rice, hybrid rice technology, biotechnology and rice based cropping systems. The agreement was signed by Dr. Mangala Rai, DG, ICAR and Dr. Robert S. Zeigler, DG, IRRI here today. The major thrust area of the work-plan for the period 2005-2008 includes genetic enhancement of rice in terms of yield and quality. It concentrates on exchanging germplasm and sharing knowledge so as to develop promising rice hybrids suitable for large scale cultivation in India. The main objective of the collaboration is to apply genomic and bioinformatic technologies to discover useful genes for increasing rice productivity in India. The agreement provides for exchanging knowledge, technologies and material and executing research programmes that are beneficial for the country’s rice production. One of the major activities will be to identify constraints to large scale adoption of hybrid rice in India and develop strategies to overcome them. The work-plan gives emphasis on enriching rice grain with Iron (Fe) and Zinc (Zn) through fertilizer use. Deficiency of iron and zinc is widespread in rice eating population particularly among women. The project aims to enrich the rice growing environment with iron and zinc so that the nutrition of poor rice eating populations can be improved. Another thrust area under the agreement is to develop resilient rice varieties for drought-prone environments. Drought is the major constraint to rice production on at least 17 million ha of rainfed Riceland in India. It also affects production on about 4 million ha in dry irrigated areas dependent on surface irrigation. Thus, the thrust will be to deliver farmer-preferred varieties with improved drought tolerance and high yield potential within 6 years. Both the organizations would also collaborate in the crop resource management, socioeconomic studies, human resource development and joint publications on rice research. Improving productivity and livelihood for fragile environments, developing technologies to harness the productivity potential of salt-affected areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains and investigating the physiological basis of submergence tolerance under rainfed lowland, develop nitrogen, residue and weed management for minimum-tilled rice production systems that are efficient in labor, water, energy, and agro-chemical use and develop aerobic rice system are other thrust areas. More than 15,000 of about 80,000 accessions in the International Rice Genebank (IRG) are from India. These have provided vital traits to IRRI rice breeding programmes for disease and insect resistance, and salinity and submergence tolerance. Oryza nivara, a wild rice from Uttar Pradesh, was, until recently, the only known source of resistance to grassy stunt virus. The previous work-plan (2001-2004) resulted in exchange of significant amount of rice germplasm. About 220 breeding lines from 22 sources were used in the rice breeding programme in India. Also, an efficient marker assisted selection system was developed for the successful transfer of a major gene. The results of previous work-plan demonstrated that modest N applications (40 kg/ha) increased upland rice productivity by over 40% on average. Rice is the staple food of two thirds of Indians and source of income and employment for more than 100 million farming families in rural India. India is now the second largest producer of rice. During 2001-2002, a record 93.34 million tons of rice was produced. Area under hybrid rice increased from 200,000 ha in 2001 to 560,000 ha in 2004 and Hybrid Rice seed yields increased from 800 kg/ha in 2001 to 1200 kg/ha in 2004. This has been possible through innovative research and development of technologies by the Indian scientists and their adoption by the farmers. ",https://www.icar.org.in/node/2868,-,Rice,Agriculture

Bridging Rice Yield Gaps through Machine Transplanting of Rice (MTR),-,"The labor scarcity due to COVID-19 Pandemic has led to the popularization of mechanized methods of rice establishment in the various parts of the country. The Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) has gained popularity in Punjab and Haryana during the last two years. The initiative of KVK-CSISA Network shows the opportunity of scaling Machine Transplanting of Rice (MTR) for securing consistently higher paddy yield in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains (EIGP). The shift from labor intensive activity to mechanization will play a crucial role in the rice-based ecosystem. The same yield of rice and rice-wheat cropping system can be achieved in EIGP if agronomic management is at par with Punjab and Haryana. The KVK-CSISA Network has harnessed the best from Farmers’ Participatory Process (FPP) in the situations where land and water resources are at the command of farmers.                        Shri Parmod Chaudhary, a farmer from Village Lazar Mahadeva, District Mahrajganj, Eastern Uttar Pradesh practiced MTR and Zero Tillage in Wheat (ZTW) under the supervision of KVK-CSISA Scientists from 2010-11. Due to labor scarcity after implementation of MNREGA, he bought the advanced version of South Korean Paddy Transplanter in 2010. The machine can transplant 8 to 10 Acres / day. The Machine transplanting was done in rows at 28 Cm apart during the 3rd week of June every year. For MTR, 12-18-day-old seedlings were transplanted with a 6-row self-riding type paddy transplanter (Dandong Self Propelled - Ride on Transplanter). The nurseries for MTR were sown on dry beds with a recommended package of practice. During the last 8 years, continuously more tillers per plant and more yield in MTR were recorded. The successful results of this trial show that MTR is the best option to increase rice yield and MTR followed by ZTW is the best to increase the rice-wheat cropping system yield. The technology allowed the farmers to manage time and intensification of the cropping system with less cost. The paddy yield and productivity growth has been flagged as an essential part for better agronomic management which can make the system more resilient and sustainable. The average system yield of 12.0 t/ha has been achieved at the site. The technology has outperformed at the farm because of better quality South Korean Model which worked efficiently as compared to other models. Given the average yield of 6.9 t/ha at this farm and that of average of 3.4 t/ha from 6 Districts in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a potential of sustained productivity growth of rice in these ecologies. On another site of 70 Acres in village Kathotia in Sidharthnagar District, Shri Parmod has been practicing MTR since the last 8 years with the same yield potential. The plot was Laser Land Levelled first in 2010 and again in 2014. The land was fertilized with 150 Kg N as Urea and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), 60 Kg P2O5 as DAP, 60 Kg K2O as Muriate of Potash (MOP) and 25 Kg ZnSO4 per hectare. The Medium duration rice variety - BPT-5204 was used by the farmer in combination with other management practices like irrigation, weed and nutrient from Kharif - 2011 to Kharif - 2019. The Paddy yield ranged from 6 t/ha to 7.65 t/ha in six out of 8 years. Paddy yield of 5.73 t/ha in the Year - 2015 was due to attack of sheath blight and WBPH. So, it can be concluded that:   (Source: KVK-CSISA Network) ",https://www.icar.org.in/node/5814,-,Rice,Agriculture

Rice Value Chain in PPP mode for increasing Farm income and Entrepreneurship,-,"Among the various approaches to increase farm income and promote entrepreneurship, the prospect of value chain is being advocated in agriculture and allied sectors. Dr. Trilochan Mohapatra , Secretary (DARE) & Director General (ICAR) (former Director, ICAR-NRRI) first made an attempt to operationalize in rice. According to him, the rice value chain besides having the fundamental benefits have some added prospective which were (i) rice will continue to dominate the farm production for various socio-economic and cultural reasons in spite of poor financial gains and market glut, (ii) demand in the  national and international market for quality rice is quite apparent (iii) apart from farmers other stake holders can join the chain leading to creation of additional employment and (iv) quality and specialty rice varieties developed by research institutes can spread quickly with less investment in extension. Having the above logic in view, the planning for the model was initiated.  Planning the Model:
Several brainstorming sessions, consultations and focused group discussions were held to decide the objectives, stake holders, activities, links, responsibilities of the party and benefits sharing. Finally, a chain emerged in PPP mode with the need for five parties including ICAR- National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack                                                       The Process:
The objective of the rice value chain was to promote large scale cultivation of high quality rice varieties of this institute in contiguous patches, undertake its processing and trade so that the consumers have access to its premium quality and all the parties involved in the value chain are benefitted. The first party i.e., ICAR-NRRI, Cuttack in consultation with rice processor and trader decided the variety Geetanjali, a long slender grain aromatic rice to include in the rice value chain.  The institute being the developer of the variety and having knowledge about its characteristics is involved in its maintenance and production of quality rice. The institute provides breeder seed of Geetanjali to a seed company for production of foundation seeds to be used by the participating farmers in the chain. Another group of stake holders in rural areas like farmer and farmwomen associations are involved which need to undertake survey of the rice ecology, motivate farmers to participate in the chain, monitor the production and arrange lifting of production by the rice processor-cum-trader. The final party in the process is the rice processor and trader who lifts the production from the production site and make immediate payment to the farmers at a price better than the MSP. The processor-cum-trader finally takes the responsibility to maintain the quality and take up market strategy including pricing to create a market demand for the rice variety. The responsibility and benefits for each party have been decided and agreed upon through a memorandum of participants (MoUs). Parties in the Rice Value Chain  
1st Party- ICAR-NRRI, Cuttack (for supplying breeder seeds of Geetanjali, technical backstopping and overall monitoring); 2nd Party- Sansar Agropol Pvt. Ltd., Bhubaneswar, (A Seed Company for multiply the truthfully labeled seeds and supplying seeds to farmers groups at desired destination); 3rd Party- Ananya Mahila Bikash Samiti Sankilo, Nischintakoili, Cuttack (A Farm women group for mobilizing large number of farmers and producing grains); 4th Party- Mahanga Krushak Vikas Manch, Cuttack (A Farmers group for mobilizing large number of farmers and producing grains); and 5th Party- Sabitri Industries, Pvt. Ltd., Mayurbhanj (Rice Processor and Trader for procuring grains from farmers’ point at 20 percent above MSP, processing and marketing). The success of the first cycle:
Under this programme, 6.5 qtls. of breeder seed of Geetanjali was supplied to M/s Sansar Agropol Pvt. Ltd., Bhubaneswar by ICAR-NRRI, Cuttack for multiplication of sufficient quantity of TL seed during the kharif-2015. A total of 49.5 acres were covered under seed production in four different locations of Odisha. About 500 qt of Truthfully Labeled (TL) Seeds were produced by the company for covering about 1000 ha for production of rice during rabi 2015-16. The Monitoring Team of NRRI visited the different sites of seed production and gave suitable advice to the company for higher yield. A brochure on “Package of practices of rice variety Geetanjali”was prepared in Odia and distributed to the farmers and the seed grower for their reference. Awareness programmes were conducted in selected localities with the participation of scientists of ICAR-NRRI, Cuttack and Miller as a confidence building step. With the involvement and mobilization by the two farmers groups (3rd and 4th parties), the grain was produced in three clusters totaling 166 acres of Khurda and Cuttack districts involving 82 farmers during dry season/ rabi-2016. The average yield of the crop was recorded at 4-4.5 t/ha. After keeping for seed and household consumption, 202 tons of paddy grains were sold by the participating farmers to the 5th party i.e., Sabitri Industries at the rate of Rs. 1,740/- per quintal (i.e., 20% above MSP), amounting to a total of Rs. 35.15 lakhs. As per the agreement, payments were made to all the farmers within ten days from the date of procurement. Now, the grains are being processed and packed for marketing by the 5th party.

Herbaceum Cotton: An ideal option for coastal and inland saline soils of Gujarat,-,"गुजरात के तटवर्ती जिले में कृषि भूमियों की लवणता निरंतर बढ़ती जा रही है। भारत में लगभग 6.73 मिलियन हैक्‍टर भूमि लवण प्रभावित है और इसमें से 2.22 मिलियन हैक्‍टर केवल गुजरात राज्‍य में है। इस क्षेत्र में लवण प्रभावित काली मिटि्टयों तथा लवणीय भूजल के प्रबंधन में सहायक आर्थिक रूप से व्‍यावहारिक कृषि प्रबंधन की विधियों से इस क्षेत्र में उच्‍चतर कृषि उत्‍पादन हो          In the coastal         district of Gujarat state salinity of the agricultural lands is constantly on the increasing trend.. About 6.73 Mha of land is salt affected in India of which 2.22 Mha is present in Gujarat State only. Economically viable agro-management practices while helping in the management of salt affected black soils and saline ground water in this region would also result in higher agricultural production leading to better economic status of the farmers.   Desi cotton is known for its short staple characteristics, deep root system, resistance to diseases and pests and drought.  The ICAR-Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), Regional Research Station, Bharuch (Gujarat) has identified Desi cotton line (G Cot 23) salt tolerant and high yielding after testing over two years. Through field experimentation, the technology of cultivating Herbaceum cotton, G Cot 23 has been evolved and taken on the farmers’ field by the team of scientists. The technology was further tested on farmers’ fields and impact of the technology was assessed. Technology Adoption: On-farm Trials were undertaken on farmers’ fields in Bhal area (Rajpara village, Dholera taluka, Ahmedabad district) and Bara tract (Bojadra and  Kalak villages of Jambusar taluka, Bharuch district) and Saurashtra (Kodinar, Mangrol and Sutrapada) during 2011-2013 (two years), where G Cot 23 recorded yield of 1.8 to 1.9 t ha-1. Apart from this, cultivation of other desi cotton lines were also taken in in Kalak and Bojadra which also gave seed cotton yield in the range of 1.6 to 1.9 t/ha. Cultivation of Herbaceum cotton lines is now followed in Bhal area,  Bara tract and Saurashtra regions on saline soils.  On-farm Trials at Dhandhuka taluka
Field trials were also taken up on farmers’ fields with G. Cot 23 on saline Vertisols in four villages namly Rajpur, Mingalpur, Shela and Kamatalav in Dhandhuka taluka of Ahmedabad district indicated seed cotton yields in the range of 1.7-1.8.2 t/ha and the salinity ranged from 9.4 to 10.2 dS m-1.    Continued efforts if ICAR-CSSRI RRS, Bharuch through various NGO partners, resulted in expanding the cultivation of salt tolerant herbaceum cotton (G.Cot 23) in coastal areas of Bharuch, Anand, Ahmedabad and Junagadh districts.  Since the performance of salt tolerant cultivars was found remunerative, more number of farm units/farmers had adopted this intervention as evident from increase in number of demonstrations. Since the input costs in desi cotton were much less when compared to hybrids or Bt lines, and also due to their response to saline water irrigation, the desi cottons lines were gaining momentum in the region.  Economic Impact  Saline lands having salinity up to 8-10 dS m-1 had been profitably brought under cultivation with Herbaceum cotton, G. Cot 23 in all the three coastal regions of the state.  This had resulted in gross income in the range of Rs. 70000/= to 75000/= per hectare and net income of Rs. 45000/= to 50000/= per hectare, particularly in South Gujarat ie., in Bojadra and Kalak with B/C Ratio of 1.8 to 2.0. Through training programmes farmers were appraised the advantage of desi cotton over other lines, particularly in terms of their low water requirement, high salt tolerance and better response to saline water irrigation.  The farmers were given training on soil and water sampling, proper maintenance of the crop.  Farmers day were also organized to create awareness among farmers in saline areas about cultivation of desi cotton in salt affected areas for higher production and income.                                               The NGOs, SAVE (Jambusar), ATAAPI (Jambusar) and MAHITI (Dholera) provided the  voice based messages on G Cot 23 cultivation, its cultural aspects to the farmers in selected villages.
Our continued efforts coupled with cooperation from NGOs, SAVE, ATAAPI, MAHITI (through CSPC, Ahmedabad) has resulted in expanding the cultivation of salt tolerant herbaceum cottons in coastal areas of Bharuch, Anand and Ahmedabad districts.

All time high production in pulses,29th September 2015," ICAR has also conducted 6000 demonstrations on farmers’ fields to demonstrate the potential of  available technologies. Success of summer mungbean  has been well  documented and appreciated at various levels. The results of successful demonstrations provided enough confidence on the existing technologies to farmers, extension workers, state agencies and planners. The Government of India has also launched a massive programme on 60,000 pulses and oilseeds villages. This also encouraged farmers to  grow more pulses. Pulses remained in the main focus while increasing  minimum support price.  For  example, increase in MSP for pigeonpea was Rs. 700/q i.e., 33% increase. This also helped in increase in area under kharif pulse crops. In addition, the favourable monsoon during kharif 2010 has helped in boosting the production of kharif pulses. There was 27% increase in   pigeonpea production during kharif 2010 over the previous year.  Good monsoon during kharif provided enough moisture to raise good rabi crops. The  record production will drastically cut  down our dependence  on imports to meet the shortfall to domestic demand. Under NFSM-pulses programme, Government of India has provided enough support for breeder and quality seed production as well as training to extension workers and farmers. During the last year 240 extension personnel and 2628 farmers of different pulses growing states were trained on improved pulses production and protection technologies. These efforts need to be further strengthened to achieve self-sufficiency in pulses.
