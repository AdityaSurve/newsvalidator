Who Is Mukesh Ambani? ,Mukesh Ambani became one of the richest people in the world by inheriting Reliance Industries and helping to turn it into a market leader across several industries.,,,,,," The richest man in India and, for a brief time in 2008, a contender for the title of the richest man in the world, Mukesh Ambani is the chair and managing director of Reliance Industries, a sprawling Indian conglomerate with interests in refining, oil and gas, petrochemicals, telecoms, retail, and media.
  Ambani had a net worth of $113.9 billion as of March 2024. Most of this comes from his 42% stake in Reliance Industries, which claims to be the largest oil refining complex in the world.
 Investopedia / Hugo Lin  Ambani was born in April 1957 in Yemen. His father, Dhirubhai, moved the family to Mumbai. Dhirubhai returned to India to escape an unstable political climate and, with his cousin, founded the Reliance Commercial Corporation. The company would eventually grow into Reliance Industries Limited.
  Mukesh remained in Mumbai for college, getting a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Mumbai, then moved to Palo Alto, California, to pursue a master of business administration (MBA) at Stanford University. After graduating, he returned home to assist his father in the construction of a polyester filament yarn plant.
  Reliance received a license from the Indian government to produce polyester filament yarn when Ambani returned to India from America in 1981. The company began in 1958 under Dhirubhai’s leadership as a provider of textiles. In the 1970s, diversified into petrochemicals and refining.
  When Ambani came on board and joined the family business, it became one of the largest petrochemical companies in the world. Working under his father and then later taking control alongside his younger brother Anil, Ambani was credited for helping to bring Reliance into new growth markets and turning it into the conglomerate it is today.
  The secret to its growth was not innovation but rather utilizing the most advanced technologies and systems to implement a dynamic supply chain to achieve significant economies of scale. 
 Mukesh Ambani officially joined Reliance in 1981, dropping out of Stanford University's MBA program to help his father run the family business.  In 2002, Ambani's father died of a stroke without leaving a will. This caused a feud between Ambani and his brother Anil.
  Three years later, with the help of their mother, the two brothers agreed to split the business. Mukesh retained the flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining, and textiles, while Anil held on to telecoms, entertainment, power generation, and the asset management side of the business.
 The year Mukesh was born his father returned to India to create Reliance, which started out as a yarn trading business in Mumbai.  Since 2005, Reliance’s revenues and profits have soared. Under Mukesh’s direction, the company developed best-in-class manufacturing facilities, strengthened its petroleum operations, and branched out into new areas, such as retail, 4G wireless broadband, and media.
 The gross revenue reported by Reliance Industries for the 2023 fiscal year.  Reliance’s expansion caused its valuation to balloon. However, sentiment dipped and the share price fell flat. This has partly been blamed on corporate governance issues and Reliance’s opaque corporate structure.
  The company’s image has taken a hit, with accusations of crony capitalism and all the bad press associated with it. There have also been allegations that Reliance uses its political connections to rig the system and get favorable deals.
  Ambani has also been criticized personally for building a 400,000-square-foot swanky home in Mumbai, an area where poverty is rife.
  Ambani has been the richest man in India for several years. With an estimated net worth of over $95 billion, he’s also one of the wealthiest people in the world.
  The majority of his wealth is attributed to his 42% stake in Reliance Industries. The company's market capitalization was $235.04 billion.
  Mukesh also owns the Mumbai Indians cricket team and about a 45% stake in Jio Financials Services, which used to be a subsidiary of Reliance but was then spun off into a separate entity. Other notable assets include Antilia, his Mumbai mansion valued at more than $2.2 billion in 2020 and is now probably worth considerably more. The 48,000-square-foot, 27-storey skyscraper houses three helipads, a yoga studio, a temple, a movie theater, a ballroom, and parking for 168 vehicles,
 Most of Ambani’s net worth derives from the 42% stake he holds in Reliance Industries, a Fortune 500 company currently valued at over $200 billion. No, he wasn’t born rich. His father initially worked as a gas station attendant and when the family moved to Mumbai shortly after his birth, they reportedly lived in a small, cheap apartment in a large tenement building known locally as a chawl. The bulk of Reliance’s revenues come from oil and chemicals, followed by retail, and digital services.  Mukesh Ambani became the richest man in Asia and one of the richest people in the world by helping to turn his father’s company, Reliance Industries, into a huge conglomerate and market leader across several industries. The company is worth over $200 billion, and its chair and managing director, Mukesh Ambani, owns just under half of it.

  Forbes estimates his net worth to be worth $92.4 billion.
   Investopedia / Hugo Lin  Ambani was one of four children of Dhirubhai Ambani, who moved his family to Mumbai, where they lived in a small apartment, while he grew his business. The family was very poor and struggled before the company's success. Ambani's family and cousin founded Reliance Commercial Corporation, which began as a textile-trading business. It operated in the beginning out of one room, rented office space, but it succeeded and created wealth for Dhirubhai and his family, which was inherited by Ambani and his siblings.

  His successes with Reliance position him as a leading voice in both the Indian and world economies. He is a member of several prominent national and international boards that help inform India’s emerging economy and its role in the global economy, including the Prime Minister’s Council on Trade and Industry, the Government of India, and the Board of Governors of the National Council of Applied Economic Research, India.

Most of Reliance’s success has not come from innovation but rather by utilizing the most advanced technologies and systems to implement a dynamic supply chain to achieve significant economies of scale. 
  Under Ambani's direction, Reliance has developed best-in-class manufacturing facilities that have raised the company’s profile, particularly in petrochemicals. The company’s facilities in Jamnagar in Gujarat combine to make it the world’s largest petroleum refinery. He also took the company into retail by developing and implementing a pan-India retail network that includes multiple formats and supply chain infrastructure.

It offers end-solutions that cut across the digital value chain, touching on key areas throughout the Indian economy such as education, healthcare, security, financial services, and entertainment. In digital, the company’s 4G phone service, Jio, has allowed it to solidify and expand its customer base.
  The company’s digital entry created something of a price war in India’s telecom market, one of the world’s most competitive. Free domestic phone calls, inexpensive data plans, and nearly free smartphones have made Reliance a significant player in the industry.
  JioMart, the company's new e-commerce platform, soft-launched in 2019, and expanded greatly in 2020 and 2021.

India's Reliance Jio Plans To Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency,"India's richest man, Reliance Jio chair Mukesh Ambani, is developing a cryptocurrency called JioCoin.",,,,,," There is some interesting news related to cryptocurrencies coming in from India. Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited is planning its own cryptocurrency, dubbed as JioCoin. Reliance Jio has been instrumental in changing the landscape of India’s telecom sector with its discount offers and very competitive tariffs.
  Reliance Industries Limited is a Fortune 500 company and the largest private sector corporation in India. 
  According to a recent news report, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd plans to create its own cryptocurrency, JioCoin. “The company plans to hire 50 young professionals with average age of 25 years for Akash Ambani to lead. There are multiple applications of blockchain (for the company). The team would work on various blockchain products.”
  Akash Ambani is the son of Reliance Jio chair Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man whose net worth reportedly tops $40 billion.
  A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ""completed"" blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order. It allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. 
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is the most popular application of the blockchain technology. In fact, it is bitcoin which introduced blockchain to the world. Reliance Jio plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency. In the present time, there are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies with a combined market capitalization of almost $700 billion, with bitcoin dominating 43%.
  This project is in line with Reliance Jio's mission wherein it “promises to shape the future of India by providing end-to-end digital solutions for businesses, institutions and households and seamlessly bridging the rural-urban divide.”
  India has seen a phenomenal rise in interest among its people for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past year. The country offers the perfect conditions for adoption of such technology. India is the home to the second-largest population (1.2 billion) in the world with 63% of its population under age 35. This, when combined with the fast-growing smartphone and internet penetration amid a digital revolution, makes India a fertile land for innovative digital technology.
  While the young and tech-savvy people in India are interested in indulging in these emerging technologies, the stance of the government currently continues to be cautious.
  In December 2017, the Reserve Bank of India reinstated its cautious stance towards bitcoin and virtual currencies. The apex bank issued the first of such note in December 2013. In February 2017, it clarified that it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any virtual currency.
  In January 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jailey said, “The government is examining the matter. A Committee under the chairship of the Economic Affairs Department Secretary is deliberating over all issues related to cryptocurrencies to propose specific actions to be taken... Instead of taking any knee-jerk action, let's wait for the report of this committee.”
  While regulatory ambiguity continues, some of the biggest banks in the country, including State Bank of India and ICICI Bank, have been experimenting on the use-cases of blockchain.

Adani Faces Deadline as Fraud Allegations Spook Investors,Indian conglomerate has suffered market losses of $68 billion following a critical report by a U.S. short seller.,,,,,," The clock is ticking for Gautam Adani as India's leading tycoon, and Asia's wealthiest person, confronts a U.S. short seller claiming he ""uncovered evidence of brazen accounting fraud, stock manipulation and money laundering"" amounting to ""the largest con in corporate history"" at Adani's business empire.
  Adani companies lost $20 billion in market value on Friday and another $17 billion Monday, taking their losses to $68 billion since the Jan. 24 report by Hindenburg Research, as shares of the seven Adani Group affiliates listed on India's stock market plunged.
  The capital losses could grow uglier still if a crucial stock offering by Adani Enterprises, the conglomerate's flagship company, falls short of its $2.5 billion fundraising goal at its scheduled conclusion on Tuesday. The offering, launched the day after Hindenburg's report, was only 2% subscribed before Abu Dhabi's International Holding announced a $400 million investment Monday. The same investment group controlled by the emirate's royal family invested nearly $2 billion in Adani companies last year.
   Central to Hindenburg's allegations is its claim that Adani and his family secretly control a network of offshore funds whose holdings of Adani companies' public shares nominally satisfy a listing requirement preventing corporate insiders and their affiliates from owning more than 75% of the share float. The same shell entities engage in share manipulation and money laundering, according to Hindenburg. The firm also questioned the competence and independence of the auditors certifying the financial results of Adani Enterprises and a sister company.
  In the two days following Hindenburg's publication, Adani Group responded only with two short statements. The first dismissed the critical report as ""a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by India’s highest courts."" The second called it an ""intentional and reckless attempt by a foreign entity to mislead the investor community."" 
  On Sunday, Adani issued a 413-page response that dismissed some of Hindenburg's allegations as old news, disproven by official investigations or else disclosed in public securities filings.Adani also said it discloses all transactions with related parties and conducts them on an arms-length basis.
  ""This is not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India,"" the company said.
  Gautam Adani, 60, is a native of Gujarat, also the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two have been close, with Adani rallying political support for Modi. In turn, his companies, focused mainly on infrastructure and energy, have won big public contracts in furtherance of Modi's economic development goals. Adani has been called ""Modi's Rockefeller.""
  After dropping out of college, Adani worked in the Mumbai diamond trade and then in plastics importing before launching his company. He's the survivor of an alleged kidnapping for ransom in 1997 as well as the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai's Taj hotel.
  Hindenburg Research is headed by Nathan Anderson, a 38-year-old analyst and short seller. Anderson is known for a report describing electric vehicle maker Nikola as ""an ocean of lies."" Nikola founder Trevor Milton was later convicted of defrauding investors. Hindenburg, which says its name evokes the man-made disasters its forensic accounting probes seek to uncover, said Adani's response to its report ""ignores every key allegation we raised"" while appealing to nationalism.
  Hindeberg has acknowledged concerns over the beneficial ownership of offshore funds investing in Adani companies were previously raised in 2021 by an Indian opposition lawmaker. Similarly, Hindenburg's report cited criticism of Adani companies' leverage published last year by the unrelated research firm CreditSights, which is owned by Fitch Ratings. CreditSights issued several reports last year calling Adani companies overly leveraged.
  Adani Group has said it's considering legal action, while Hindenburg has said it would welcome a U.S. suit since it has a long list of documents it would request as part of a discovery process. At the same time, Hindenburg has been careful to note that its bet against Adani is via U.S.-traded bonds and derivatives not traded in India, adding that its report ""relates solely to the valuation of securities traded outside of India.""
  Barring a court confrontation, the Adani stock offering due to conclude Tuesday may serve as a market verdict on Hindenburg's claims. The price range of the offering now exceeds the share price of Adani Enterprises amid investor concerns, while some dollar-denominated bonds issued by Adani companies now trade below 70 cents per dollar of face value. ""How does a group that big explain no analyst coverage and no mutual fund holdings?” one investment analyst told Bloomberg.
  Four of the seven listed Adani companies had more than doubled in value in the year before Hindenburg's report, while Adani Enterprises was also sitting on a three-year gain of nearly 1,400%, according to Hindenburg, which said the Adani Group ""appears to be highly overvalued"" based on the company's own accounting.
  If Monday's losses in Adani shares cost Gautam Adani the distinction as Asia's richest human, as they might, taking his place would be archrival tycoon Mukesh Ambani, who trailed Adani's $92.7 billion fortune by $11.4 billion as of Sunday, according to Bloomberg. Their respective conglomerates have recently extended their competition to branded food staples, even as Adani called Mukesh Ambani ""a very good friend.""

 The GDP per capita in India, which has risen in recent years.  India has a long tradition of entrepreneurship, but with its own distinct flavor. Rather than founding technology firms, many Indian entrepreneurs came from hard-working, humble beginnings and created conglomerates that were passed down from generation to generation as family businesses. But that's not to say that future Indian entrepreneurs won't focus on technology and help drive India's economic growth.
  Still, we should not forget that GDP per capita in this country of over 1 billion people is just $1,927.7 per year, demonstrating one of the highest rates of income inequality in the world.

Top 10 Wealthiest Families in the World,Learn more about the top 10 wealthiest families in the world and how they made their fortunes.,,,,,," Regardless of your financial status, keeping tabs on the ultrarich—whether with admiration, envy, or resentment—is probably more pleasurable and less demanding than researching a mortgage, shopping for online brokers, or studying finance and economics.
  The appeal of wealthy families reflects a culture that idolizes wealth and fetishizes the rich. Those in the upper echelons of business are celebrities in many people's eyes, and they are scrutinized for their ability (or failure) to maintain this elite status.
  This list is limited to families who originally made their fortunes through business (even if some of the current heirs enjoy the family inheritance without ever having contributed to it.)
  The Al Nahyan family, also referred to as the ""House of Nahyan,"" is the richest family in the world. The leader of the family, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the ruler of Abu Dhabi and the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The economy of the UAE (and the finances of its rulers and royal families) has been transformed by the vast oil reserves in the country. Abu Dhabi is one of the richest emirates, and especially oil-rich.
  Sheikh Mohamed became the ruler of Abu Dhabi and the President of the UAE in 2022. Before that, his brother, Sheikh Khalifa, was the country's leader from 2004 to 2022. And before that, his father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, was the President of the country, from its founding in 1971 until 2004, when his son succeeded him.
  The family's fortune has been amassed via ownership of billions of barrels of oil reserves, in addition to extremely profitable wealth funds.
  The Waltons are the second-richest family in the world. At the top of the value chain, Jim, Rob, and Alice Walton are each worth around $57 billion and ranked No. 19, 20, and 21, respectively, on Forbes' billionaire list as of Dec. 24, 2023.
  Walmart is a retail behemoth. Founded by Sam Walton in Arkansas in 1962, Walmart is the world’s largest company by revenues in fiscal year 2022, with $611 billion in revenues and over 2.1 million global associates.
  Walmart operates over 10,500 retail stores worldwide and 5,215 stores in the U.S. as of December 24, 2023.
  Best known for big-box stores in rural and suburban America, Walmart is celebrated for its low-priced products and criticized for its labor practices. The company failed to bring its big-box consumer lifestyle to New York City, unlike its competitor, Target.
  French fashion house and luxury purveyor Hermès has dazzled the world with its signature scarves, neckties, and perfumes, as well as its iconic Kelly and Birkin handbags. Back in the 19th century, Thierry Hermès fashioned riding apparel for the aristocracy.

  Mars is the Walmart of candy—a multigenerational family business that is ubiquitous and wildly popular. Today, the company is better known for making M&Ms than for its eponymous Mars bar. In 2017, the world’s largest candy company diversified with the purchase of VCA, a pet care company, for $9.1 billion.
  Siblings Jacqueline and John Mars, whose grandfather, Frank Mars, founded the company, each have a net worth of $38.3 billion and are tied for No. 31 on Forbes' list of billionaires as of Dec. 24, 2023.

  The Al Thani family has ruled Qatar since the middle of the 19th century. The family's reign has lasted through the founding of modern Qatar, wars, and two coup attempts.
  Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani turned Qatar into a major world power during his 18 years in power. (He gained complete power of Qatar by deposing his father in a bloodless coup in 1995. This involved freezing all of his father's assets to prevent any counter-coups.)
  The country's natural gas production skyrocketed as a result of mining offshore gas fields and the discovery of untapped oil fields. In 2010, the average income in the country was $86,440 a year per person.
  In addition to his income made from oil and gas, Sheikh Hamad invested billions of dollars in businesses, including Volkswagen, Total, Sainsbury’s, and Barclays bank. In 2018, Sheikh Hamad abdicated the throne to his fourth son, Sheikh Tamin bin Hamad al Thani.
  Charles Koch owes his staggering fortune to an oil business founded by his father, but today, he is perhaps better known to the general public for his politics, digging into his deep pockets to place his stamp on it—financing candidates and libertarian think tanks, funding university professorships, and lobbying for policy positions, all aimed at furthering a conservative agenda.
  Charles partnered with his brother David until the latter died in 2019. Charles is worth an estimated $59 billion, ranked No. 17 on the Forbes' billionaires list. David's widow, Julia Koch, and family are tied for 17th place with a net worth of $59 billion as of Dec. 25, 2023.
  The House of Saud, the Saudi royal family, has a monarchical history extending back nearly a century. The family’s massive fortune, estimated at $112 billion, has grown thanks to decades of payments from the Royal Diwan, the king’s executive office.
  Ties with Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s most profitable companies and a behemoth of the oil industry, ensure that the Saudi royal family continues to accumulate wealth. It’s difficult to accurately assess the wealth of the House of Saud, in part because the family contains as many as 15,000 extended members, many of whom have founded businesses, received government contracts, and more.
  Indian industrial conglomerate Reliance Industries, the only Asian company on our list, might be the least well-known to average readers.
  Nevertheless, CEO Mukesh Ambani, whose late father founded the company in 1957, is ninth on Forbes' billionaires list with a net worth of $83.4 billion as of Dec. 25, 2023, overseeing the company’s refining, petrochemicals, oil, gas, and textiles; his brother, Anil, manages telecommunications, asset management, entertainment, and power generation.
  French high-fashion house Chanel is legendary for the timeless “little black dress,” the No.5 perfume, and the late high-profile designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died on Feb. 19, 2019.
  Brothers Alain and Gerhard Wertheimer now co-own the company that their grandfather staked with founder Gabrielle Coco Chanel. The brothers are both ranked 41st on the Forbes billionaires list, with a net worth of $31.6 billion each as of Dec. 25, 2023.

  Roy Thomson's grandson, David Thomson, is the chairman of Thomson Reuters. He ranks 22nd on Forbes' billionaires list with a net worth of $54.4 billion as of Dec. 25, 2023.
 According to Bloomberg, with $305 billion of estimated wealth in 2023, the Al Nahyan family is the richest family in the entire world. The top 10 richest families in 2023 by estimated wealth are: The top three wealthiest people in the world as of Dec. 25, 2023, are LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. While the British royal family is a tremendous source of curiosity for many people, and the Windsor's have accumulated many properties, jewels, and art over 100 years of rule, we may never know exactly how much wealth the family has accrued. Assessing the wealth of the British royal family is difficult because of the vast array of its holdings, the historical value of these holdings, and a tradition of secrecy about financial particulars.  This list of wealthy families focused on those who built their wealth by starting a family business. Some of these family businesses—like Walmart—are now publicly traded businesses. Others, like Mars Incorporated and Koch Industries, are still privately held family businesses.
  This list may read as a naked celebration of wealth at a time of rising global inequality and a vanishing middle class. It may also be seen as condoning heedless consumption at a time when the future of wealth itself is in question. Moreover, the focus on families means the list doesn’t include the world’s three richest individuals.

"Beyoncé's Net Worth, Businesses, and Investments","Beyoncé's has made millions from her illustrious career as an artist, various businesses ventures, and lucrative brand partnerships. Here's how the Queen Bey makes her millions.",,,,,," Superstar Beyoncé Knowles-Carter has made millions from her illustrious, decades-long career as an artist. Beyoncé's latest Renaissance World Tour, which wrapped in October 2023, made a total of $579 million across Europe and the U.S., making it the highest-grossing tour by a Black artist, a record Beyoncé set herself with the Formation World Tour.
  In August, Beyoncé had the highest one-month gross in history with $179.3 million in ticket sales, surpassing her own record she set in July, per Touring Data.
  Beyoncé's shows at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium were the highest-grossing concerts by a female artist in history, earning more than $16.5 million on July 29 and 30, according to Chart Data.
  The superstar also released a concert film of the tour in December, Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which topped the box office and earned $21 million on its opening weekend. The film was written, directed, and produced by Beyoncé.
  In addition to her successful career as a singer spanning multiple decades and genres, the multi-hyphenate artist has launched various businesses and entered lucrative brand partnerships over the years as she continues to build her empire alongside billionaire husband Jay-Z.
  Beyoncé has a net worth of $540 million as of June 2023. Here's how she made her millions.
  Beyoncé's successful career has spanned more than 20 years, in which time she has released eight studio albums (14 if you include the deluxe versions of her albums and live albums), and 82 singles.
  Earlier this year, the Alien Superstar singer made history at the Grammys by becoming the most-nominated female artist in Grammy history, with a total of 88 nominations. She is tied with Jay-Z, who also holds the most-nominated title with 88 nominations.
  The pop star has been known to use unconventional ways to market her albums. Beyoncé's eponymous album, which she released in December 2013 with no announcement, had more than 800,000 downloads on iTunes in the first three days of its release and was the fastest-selling album on iTunes at the time.
  Her visual album Lemonade, known as Beyoncé's most raw and edgy album to date, was the world's best-selling album in 2016, and won a Peabody Award the same year.
  Her latest album, Renaissance sold more than 1 million total units in the U.S. in 2022.
  While Renaissance is her highest-grossing tour yet, Beyoncé has earned millions from her other concert tours, too. Her 2016 Formation World Tour earned a total of $256.1 million, while her 2018 On the Run II Tour she did with Jay-Z earned $253.5 million.
  Beyoncé has also earned millions from some private performances.
  In January 2023, Beyoncé was paid about $24 million when she performed at the launch of the Atlantis the Royal hotel in Dubai. The gig topped a Forbes' list of the 10 most expensive private performances.
  Beyoncé appears twice on the list—she performed at Isha Ambani's pre-wedding events in India in 2018, and earned an estimated $4 million, according to the Hindustan Times. Isha Ambani is the daughter of Indian billionaire, Mukesh Ambani, who is one of the richest people in the world.
  Among her many talents, Beyoncé is also an actress. Her film credits include Dreamgirls, Austin Powers in Goldmember, Obsessed, Cadillac Records, and most recently, The Lion King (2019). Beyoncé was paid an estimated $15 million for her role playing the voice of Nala in The Lion King as well as for lending her vocals for the film's soundtrack, according to StyleCaster.
  Beyoncé is also a savvy entrepreneur, and has made millions from launching lucrative businesses such as a production company, clothing line, and even an upcoming fragrance and line of hair products.
  The Grammy-winning singer supports small businesses too. Beyoncé's BeyGood foundation surprised 12 Atlanta-based Black-owned small business owners with $10,000 grants during her stop in the city for the Renaissance Tour.
  In 2010, Beyoncé founded her own production, management, and entertainment company, Parkwood Entertainment, which she uses to produce movies, music, and clothing. Projects produced through the company include two of Beyoncé's films, Cadillac Records and Obsessed, Beyoncé's documentary, Life Is But a Dream, and Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé. 
  Parkwood Entertainment also launched Beyoncé's streetwear and athleisure line with Adidas, Ivy Park. Ivy Park brought in $93 million in revenue in 2021, and $40 million in 2022, before Beyoncé and Adidas parted ways in 2023.
  Beyoncé has ventured into beauty, too. In November 2023, Beyoncé launched a perfume, Cé Noir, which retails for $160 per bottle.
  The 'Crazy in Love' singer also teased a hair care line on her Instagram in May 2023, but further information is yet to be released.
  Adding to her list of accolades and titles, Beyoncé is also a model and brand ambassador who has had many lucrative partnerships with brands over the years. In 2012, Beyoncé signed a $50 million deal with PepsiCo (PEP).
  In 2019, Beyoncé signed a $60 million contract with Netflix (NFLX) for a three-project deal, according to Variety. The first special Homecoming, a behind-the-scenes look at her 2018 Coachella performance, is already on Netflix.
  In March 2023, Beyoncé created a couture collection in collaboration with Swatch Group (SWGAY) owned-French fashion house, Balmain. The collection features 16 couture outfits inspired by the songs on Beyoncé's Renaissance album.
  In July 2023, the singer announced a partnership with LVMH-owned (LVMUY) Tiffany & Co., called The Return to Tiffany x Beyoncé Collection. All of the profits from the sales of the collection will go to the About Love scholarship program, which is part of Beyoncé's BeyGood foundation.

Are You As Frugal As Warren Buffett?,Warren Buffett’s house in Omaha is an example of the billionaire’s famous frugality. Discover the secrets that helped the Oracle of Omaha amass wealth.,,,,,," Warren Buffett's house in Omaha has always been the focus of intense interest and for good reason. Buffett has earned a reputation as the world's greatest stock investor, and his long-term track record suggests that the title is well deserved.
  He was worth $99.4 billion as of Sept. 10, 2022, according to Forbes' real-time billionaire net worth calculator. At age 92, Buffett is still legendarily frugal. He resides in the same house in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, that he bought for $31,500 in 1958. But he also had a beach house in California that he bought for $150,000 in 1971. He sold it for $7.5 million, down from an original listing of $11 million, in 2018.
  His tastes otherwise are simple and they include McDonald's hamburgers and cherry Coke. His lack of interest in computers and luxury cars is well documented. Underlying Buffett's legendary success is one simple fact: He's a value investor. And that's the hallmark trait of both his professional success and his lifestyle.
  The home Buffett bought for his family in 1958 for $31,500 is a handsome stone and stucco house on a tree-lined street in the Dundee neighborhood of Omaha. With five bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, it spans about 6,570 feet. The home's 2023 estimate is $1,44 million. Buffett calls it ""the third-best investment I ever made.""
  By way of contrast, Jeff Bezos, one of Buffett's rivals for richest-guy-in-the-world status, spent $165 million on a sprawling estate in Beverly Hills, California. His goal was to add it to the $10 million spread next door that he already owned.
  The richest person in India, Mukesh Ambani, built a 27-floor high-rise as his principal residence. Buffett could afford it, or, for that matter, Buckingham Palace, which is said to be the world's most valuable property estimated at $6.7 billion. Buffett apparently doesn't see the need for 78 bathrooms.
  Warren Buffett's definition of personal success and luxury was revealed in an interview with CNBC, and it provides some insight into his philosophy. ""Success is really doing what you love and doing it well,"" Buffett said. ""It's as simple as that. Really getting to do what you love to do every day—that's really the ultimate luxury. Your standard of living is not equal to your cost of living.""
  And what Buffett loves to do every day is work at Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate that he built from the bones of an ailing cotton fabric manufacturer.
  Buffett is not an accumulator of toys and other trappings of wealth. He views the maintenance and expenses associated with these things as a burden. It's a view that extends to cellphones and computers.
 ""The first rule of investing is don't lose money. The second rule is, don't forget rule number one."" -Warren Buffett  When CNBC asked him what the one thing was that he believed young people should be doing to be smarter about money, his primary advice was to ""stay away from credit cards.""
  As a value investor, Buffett is always looking for a bargain. Even his second wedding was a simple affair. A man who could have chosen any venue in the world married his second wife, Astrid Menks, in 2006 in Omaha at a private ceremony held at his daughter's house. The ceremony lasted 15 minutes.
  Warren Buffett loves his job. He often says that nothing is more fun than running Berkshire Hathaway, so he doesn't spend a lot of money on hobbies, relaxation, travel, and other escapes from his day job.
  Like many born entrepreneurs, Buffett never had a desire to work for someone else. His ambition was to start his own company rather than complain about the one he was working for. That in itself could be a key to future wealth for like-minded people.
  Now that you understand Buffett's interpretation of frugality, it begs asking what steps you can take to implement these goals in your own life. Buffett has had plenty to say about some habits and patterns that will help you along.
  Ask yourself if you really need an item or asset you're on the verge of purchasing or if you just want it. Maybe you think it will add a little flash to your image. Buffett has said that his goal is ""not to make people envious."" He warns, ""Don't confuse the cost of living with the standard of living."" Do not live above your means. Buffett recommends living below your means.
  This is an extension of the want vs. need equation. Buffett has advised that liquor and tobacco should not be on your ""to buy"" list. They're expensive, or at least they are if you're not purchasing the cheapest bottle of vino you can find. And who wants to drink that? This isn't just a judgment on how to pursue frugality. Buffett has never smoked or drank and that has no doubt helped him amass a good many years of life that he could put toward making money.
  Now it's time to consider how you're going to pay for that purchase that you've determined you do indeed need. Buffett has advised that you shouldn't be shy about whipping out those coupons you saved and handing them over at the cash register, even if you're in the company of friends. They don't have the right to judge you and you shouldn't be burdened with a need to impress them, particularly because they're not paying for the purchase themselves.
  Coupons won't save money if you then pay for the purchase with a credit card. Maybe you shaved $10 off the cost of your groceries. You haven't saved $10 if you then swipe your plastic to pay the tab. Now you're giving your credit card lender that money in the form of interest. Paying interest on credit cards probably indicates that you're living beyond your means and you're throwing money away. Both are incompatible with Buffett's philosophy.
  It can be said that investing is a form of gambling but that's not the case if you do it the way Buffett does. Keep in mind that his motto stresses analysis and research as part of the art of investing wisely. Rolling the dice at a craps table or putting money down on that Kentucky Derby pony is just another way of giving away your hard-earned money.
 The Wall Street Journal has reported that only a mere 13.5% of gamblers win.  Your next step is to make more money after you've stopped giving it away and wasting it. Buffett has a clear strategy for doing this. ""The first rule of investing is don't lose money. The second rule is, don't forget rule number one,"" he says.
  It's a strategy he employs in his personal life as well and it begins by living far below his means. He's not interested in keeping up with the Joneses although, in his case, the Joneses probably have a private island and a jet to get there.
  Despite a net worth measured in the billions, Warren Buffett has earned a base salary of just $100,000 a year for more than 25 years at Berkshire Hathaway. His total compensation in 2020 was $380,328.
 Born on Aug. 30, 1930 in Omaha, Warren Buffett is a graduate of the University of Nebraska and he holds a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Business. He bought Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 1965 and it has served ever since as the holding company for his expanding empire. A strong believer in long-term value investing, he amassed such large stakes in public companies over the years that his investment fund essentially became a public conglomerate. Buffett has publicly committed to donating 99% of his wealth to charity. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns some very familiar American brand names including Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, GEICO Insurance, and See's Candies. The company also holds a large number of shares in Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Kraft Heinz. Warren Buffett is a value investor. In other words, he's a bargain hunter. He looks for stocks that appear to have a potential for earnings that are not reflected in their current stock prices. He is by no means a stock speculator. He's owned shares of Coca-Cola stock since the 1980s.  Billionaire status is out of reach for most of us, but that's not the point. You're as far from future wealth as anyone can be if you're letting your entire income slip through your hands in discretionary spending and unnecessary expenses.
  As it turns out, people can learn a lot from the Oracle of Omaha, about living well as well as investing wisely.

5 Things to Know Before The Stock Market Opens,U.S. stocks edged higher after Friday’s record and Macy’s turned down a takeover bid. Here’s what investors need to know today.,,,,,," U.S. stocks edged higher after Friday’s record and Macy’s turned down a takeover bid. Here’s what investors need to know today.

Adani Rout Gathers Speed on Fresh Signs of Distrust,The Indian conglomerate looked increasingly isolated amid fraud allegations as banks clamp down on using its bonds as margin collateral.,,,,,," Stocks and bonds of Adani Group companies crashed to new lows Thursday after the Indian conglomerate canceled an equity offering it had pursued as a vote of confidence in the wake of accusations of widespread fraud by a U.S. short-seller.
  The $2.5 billion secondary offering scrapped by Adani Enterprises (ADANIENT.NS) shortly after its completion prompted questions that echoed criticism by Hindenburg Research of Adani's corporate governance and the transparency of India's capital markets.
  The cancellation came as two Western banks stopped accepting Adani bonds as margin loan collateral, while a prominent UK politician resigned as a director of a London firm that Hindenburg said participated in Adani's alleged schemes to manipulate share prices. Adani Enterprises shares plunged 27% Thursday on the heels of Wednesday's 28% drop.
  A subsidiary of the London firm, Elara Capital, was listed as one of the 10 bookrunners for the stock sale after Adani's allies in India's business community and among its strategic Middle East investors ensured it was fully subscribed in a last-day push. U.S. hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has supported Hindenburg's claims, said on Twitter he ""would not find it surprising if the Adani offering was rigged with affiliated buyers.""
  Hindenburg's report quoted two unidentified former traders for Mauritius-based funds run by Elara in alleging Adani used them to conceal the extent of the family's ownership of listed shares in its companies and to manipulate their share prices. Adani has denied Hindenburg's allegations, as well as any affiliation with Elara. Elara has yet to explain why 99% of its $3 billion Elara India Opportunities Fund based in Mauritius is invested in Adani companies.
  Gautam Adani, the conglomerate's CEO, said in a video address to investors that his Adani Enterprises flagship canceled the offering ""to insulate the investors from potential losses."" Adani's own losses, meanwhile, totaled $12.5 billion Wednesday, shrinking his net worth to $72.1 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. Adani, a key supporter of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fell to 12th place in the global wealth ranking and second in India behind rival tycoon Mukesh Ambani. Adani's losses have cast a pall over India's stock market, pushing it below France to sixth largest by market value globally.
  ""Our balance sheet is healthy and assets robust,"" Adani said in his address to investors. ""Our EBITDA levels and cash flows have been very strong, and we have an impeccable track record of fulfilling our debt obligations.""
  Meanwhile, Adani Group's gross debt increased 40% in its most recent fiscal year as the conglomerate expanded beyond its port infrastructure and coal power roots into industries like cement, roads, data centers, and renewables, prompting cautionary commentary from some analysts.
  While Adani Enterprise shares are now down 54% since Hindenburg's Jan. 24 report, that's only returned the price to what was its all-time high in May 2021. At that point, the stock had already appreciated 11-fold in the course of a year. Hindenburg cited the rapid gains in Adani share prices over recent years to support its claims of market manipulation. In November, Bloomberg called the gains—as much as 2,000% over four years for some of Adani's stocks—""eyebrow-raising.""
  The share sale, planned to broaden the company's shareholder base and analyst coverage, ended up framed as a referendum on Adani's governance and Hindenburg's claims. But the offering's price range was more than 30% above Adani's share price after Wednesday's plunge. The cancellation leaves open the possibility that the key Middle East investors and Indian business magnates who subscribed to the offering just ahead of the deadline knew their votes of confidence were refundable.
  If Adani's allies come to his rescue again, their support may need to be more overt than the state-owned insurance company's participation in the abortive offering, or the heavy lending in recent years to Adani Group companies by the State Bank of India, the country's largest bank and one in which the government holds a majority stake.
  Adani and Modi have promoted what some in India call the ""Gujarat development model,"" named after both men's home state. The model featured exclusive and lucrative infrastructure development contracts for Adani, who in turn provided Modi with political support and India's economy with vital infrastructure improvements. India has grown rapidly in recent years after decades of stagnation under a heavy-handed centralized bureaucracy derisively labeled the License Raj.
  In a recent column for an Indian business magazine, one economist wrote that ""Japan, not China, should be India’s role model. The Japanese model is to bring together political leaders and big business to chart a national strategy for continued growth.""
  But close ties between governments and favored tycoons can bring their own problems, the author is discovering. He is Meghnad Desai, a member of the British House of Lords and an Elara non-executive director who told the Financial Times he has contacted financial regulators in Mauritius to seek more information on Hindenburg's allegations regarding his firm.
  ""If it is correct that Elara was used as a vehicle indirectly by the Adanis then we have to worry about that,"" the newspaper quoted Desai as saying. ""If this is not clarified by the [Indian] government they are going to have a serious problem attracting foreign capital.""
