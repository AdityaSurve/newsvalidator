A significant testament of the same was witnessed from the way the world’s largest free vaccination campaign against COVID-19 took shape with the Government of India at helm. 

The two-month ‘Har Ghar Dastak 2.0’ campaign commenced on June 1, 2022 to expedite COVID-19 vaccination coverage to include all eligible beneficiaries through door-to-door campaigns with special focus on people in old age homes, schools/colleges, prisons and brick kilns.

Being implemented in a “Mission Mode”, States and Union Territories (UTs) have been advised to give an effective thrust towards full vaccination coverage for all eligible beneficiaries.

After the dangerous second wave of infections in the country, more than 3,000 laboratories came up to test patients’ samples of COVID-19 virus in almost no time where at the beginning of such testing, there used to be only one such laboratory.

Pediatric care units in 631 districts of the country have come up through the Emergency Response Package of the Government of India. Health for everyone is pledge of new India.",-,0.8326328992843628,False,True,Neutral,0.425,Objective,0.47286522

Delivering the keynote address on medical value travel (MVT), Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul said that the Government of India will soon be launching a “Heal in India” initiative to leverage its healthcare services for international patients, “Heal by India” initiative to send out healthcare workforce to other countries and capitalise its strength in the telemedicine sector to pave the way for “Heal from India” initiative.

Dr Paul also pitched for a wider use of traditional medical practices like Ayurveda in the MVT sector. According to him, MVT should focus on maintaining, improving or restoring health through medical intervention instead of the common parlance of visiting another country to seek medication. “It can be achieved by providing access to quality and cost-effective medical care, transparent pricing, seamless travel to medical value travel destinations, attainment of Universal Health Coverage and ensuring low waiting time for medical treatment”",Joe Mathew,0.8484760522842407,True,True,Positive,0.3333333333333333,Objective,0.46133453
